0|Hatsun Food Company Shri R G vs Commissioner Of Central Excise on 3 September 2004|ORDER P G Chacko Member J 1 These appeals are against an order of the Commissioner of Central Excise confirming a demand of duty of over Rs 1 8 crores against M s Hatsun Food Company HFC in short imposing on them penalties under Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act and Rule 173 Q of the Central Excise Rules 1944 and also imposing penalties on Shri R C Chandramogan Managing Partner of the above firm and Shri Raja K S P Ganesan Partner of the above firm under Rule 209 A of the said Rules The demand of duty is on excisable goods cleared by M s HFC to M s Hatsum Agro Products Ltd HAPL in short during the period 1995 96 to 98 99 It is on a value addition made by the department on the basis of the price at which M s HAPL sold the goods to their customers which in turn is based on a finding that HFC and HAPL are related persons under Section 4 4 c of the Central Excise Act It appears from the records that a major part of the production in HFC s factory was sold to HAPL and the remaining part sold at factory gate to other independent buyers The value addition proposed by the department in the relevant show cause was opposed by HFC who took the view that where factory gate sales to independent buyers were available it was the price for such sales that would constitute normal price for the purpose of assessment of the goods to duty of excise and that the price at which the major buyer whether related or not sold that goods to the ultimate customers was irrelevant The show cause notice incidentally also proposed penalties on HFC and its partners This proposal was also resisted In adjudication of the dispute the Commissioner passed the impugned order the operative part of which has already been outlined 2 Ld Chartered Accountant submits that the valuation issue arising in Appeal No E 307 2004 is similar to the issue which had arisen before this Bench in the case of Hatsun Milk Food Ltd and Ors Appeal Nos E 1845 to 1849 99 MAS which was decided as per Final Order No 1303 1307 2000 dated 16 8 2000 in favour of the assessee Ld C A submits that the conclusion arrived at in the said order is squarely applicable to the instant case It is also pointed out that the said Final Order was not challenged by the Revenue and has become final and binding on them The demand of duty requires to be set aside following the decision of this Bench in the case of Hatsun Milk Food Ltd supra Consequently the penalties also require to be vacated 3 Ld SDR has endeavoured defend the order of the Commissioner by harping on the aspect of lifting the corporate veil She has spoken of unity of interest between HFC and HAPL She considers that HFC is the manufacturing unit and HAPL is their marketing limb This way she seeks to establish mutuality of interest between them and thereby relationship between them in terms of Section 4 4 c ibid Ld SDR therefore submits that the valuation of the goods cleared by HFC to HAPL during the material period should be based on the price at which the latter sold the goods to their customers In his rejoinder Ld C A submits that any relationship between HFC and HAPL is irrelevant inasmuch as factory gate sale price charged to independent buyers is readily available His reliance in this connection is on the Supreme Court s judgment in the case of Union of India v Kantilal Chunilal and Ors 1987 1 ECC 1 SC 1986 26 ELT 289 SC 4 We have considered the submissions and the cited case law We find that there is a clear parallel between this case and the case of Hatsun Milk Food M s Hatsun Milk Food Ltd had sold their major production to a party who was considered by the department as related to the assessee and the remaining goods were sold to buyers who were admittedly unrelated In that case it was also an admitted fact that the prices at which sales had been effected to the so called related person were at levels higher than those charged to unrelated buyers during the relevant period This Bench by following the ruling of the Apex Court judgment in Kantilal Chunilal supra held that the goods sold by M s Hatsun Milk Food Ltd to the so called related buyer were liable to be assessed on the basis of the price at which the former sold identical goods at factory gate to other independent buyers It was held that the relationship if any was irrelevant to such a valuation We find that the factual matrix of the instant case is essentially the same as that of Hatsun Milk Food The decision in the said case has become final and binding for want of challenge by Revenue and hence the same has to be followed in the instant case Accordingly we hold that the clearances effected by HFC to HAPL during the period of dispute are liable to be assessed to duty on the basis of the price at which the former were selling identical goods during the same period at factory gate to other independent buyers however small the proportion of such sales may be The assessee in this case valued their goods only on this basis and paid duty accordingly They are not liable to pay any more on those clearances The demand of duty is therefore set aside Once the demand of duty is set aside penalties should follow suit and we vacate the same The impugned order is set aside and the appeals stand allowed|28/02/2002|Customs Excise and Gold

5|Bali Alias Bahal Singh vs State Of Rajasthan on 4 January 2001|Name of accused Convicted under section Sentence awarded appellant Bali alias Banal Singh 376 IPC Five years RI and a fine of Rs 500 in default of payment of fine to further undergo RI for 3 months 450 IPC Three years RI and a fine of Rs 500 in default of payment of fine to further undergo RI for 3 months The above sentences were ordered to run concurrently 2 The facts giving rise to this appeal in short are as follows JUDGMENT Sunil Kumar Garg J 1 This is an appeal by the accused appellant against the judgment and order dated 30 4 1982 passed by the learned Sessions Judge Sri Ganganagar in Sessions Case No 34 1981 by which the learned Sessions Judge convicted the accused appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450 IPC and sentenced in the following manner On 10 1 1981 PW 1 Indobai lodged an oral report Ex P 1 before PW 7 Mani Ram who was SHO on that day at Police Station Matilirathan District Sri Ganganagar stating inter alia that day before yesterday she had gone to Gurusar to take the Muklawa of her son Mahendra and Mahendra was also with her It is further stated in the report that at her house she has left her daughters Mst Mukhtyaro PW 2 prosecutrix aged about 28 years and Guddi PW 3 aged about 16 years and Pappi aged about 10 years and her husband was also out of station and had gone to Bikaner PW 2 Mukhtyaro was married and she had one son of one and half years and for the last one and half years she has been living with PW 1 Indobai It is further stated in the report that on the previous day i e on 9 1 1981 she has come to her house and when she came she was informed by PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix that at about 2 00 p m when she was sitting in her house on the cot and combing her hair Guddi and Pappi had gone to the field and accused appellant came there and committed rape on her It is further stated in the report that thereafter PW 3 Shishuguddi came there and she made hue and cry and thereafter accused appellant ran away from the scene and when he was running he was seen by PW 5 Kartar Singh and PW 4 Chandu Ram It is further stated in the report that as she was having no transportation therefore report has been lodged on the next day i e on 10 1 1981 On this report PW 7 Maniram registered the case and started investigation During investigation PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix was got medically examined by PW 6 Dr Rajendra Kumar and her medical examination report is Ex P 3 and the report determining her age is Ex P 4 where her age has been determined as 20 years After usual investigation a challan was filed against the accused appellant in the Court of Magistrate and from where the case was committed to the Court of Session On 28 7 1981 the learned Sessions Judge Sri Ganganagar framed charges against the accused appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450 IPC The charges were read over and explained to the accused appellant The accused appellant denied the charges and claimed trial During the course of trial the prosecution examined as many as seven witnesses and got exhibited several documents Thereafter statement of the accused appellant under Section 313 Cr P C was recorded No evidence was led by the accused appellant in defence After conclusion of trial the learned Sessions Judge Sri Ganganagar vide his judgment and order dated 30 4 1982 convicted the accused appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450 IPC and sentenced in the manner as stated above Before proceeding further it may be stated here that when the statement of PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix was being recorded by the learned Sessions Judge he felt that she was suffering from mental disease and she was not in a position to give statement and therefore he ordered that her mental state be got examined by the doctor On the file there is a report of the Superintendent Mental Hospital Jaipur dated 27 2 1982 which speaks that PW 2 Mukhtyaro was suffering from mental retardation and her mental age was three years and I Q was 21 It may further be stated here that because of this fact her statement could not be recorded and proceedings have taken place in the absence of her statement The learned Sessions Judge while recording conviction of the accused appellant came to the following conclusions 1 That on the date of incident PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix was patient of mental retardation 2 That PW 6 Dr Rajendra Kumar has proved X ray report Ex P 4 and has come to the conclusion that on the date of incident the age of PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix was 20 years 3 That PW 6 Dr Rajendra Kumar has come to the conclusion that no definite opinion can be given about the commission of rape with PW 2 Mukhtyaro in the absence of FSL report and the FSL report has not been produced in the present case 4 That the learned Sessions Judge has relied on the evidence of PW 3 Shishuguddi and after relying on her statement he has convicted the accused appellant for the offence under Sections 376 and 450 IPC Aggrieved from the said judgment and order dated 30 4 1982 passed by the learned Sessions Judge Sri Ganganagar the present appeal has been filed by the accused appellant 3 In this appeal the following submissions have been made by the learned counsel for the accused appellant 1 That there is no evidence of intercourse with PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix by accused appellant and there is also no evidence on record which shows that PW2 Mukhtyaro has any injury on her private part and thus there is no medical evidence in this case and in such circumstances in absence of statement of PW 2 Mukhtyaro the conviction of the accused appellant for the offence under Sections 376 IPC cannot be maintained 2 That since there is statement of PW 3 Shishuguddi which shows that she saw the accused appellant committing rape on PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix therefore from this point of view also a case at the most under Section 354 IPC can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and not under Section 376 IPC as the fact that sexual intercourse by accused appellant with her has taken place in actual form has not been established by the prosecution 3 That the accused appellant is in jail for the last more than eight months and therefore he should be sentenced to the period already undergone by him 4 The learned Public Prosecutor has not much controverted the above arguments but has argued that in case the Court comes to the conclusion that a case under Section 354 IPC is made out against the accused appellant then quantum of fine be raised 5 I have heard the learned counsel for the accused appellant and the learned Public Prosecutor and perused the record of the case 6 So far as the fact that PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix was a patient of mental retardation on the date of occurrence is concerned there is no dispute on this point and because of this reason she has not been examined in Court and thus there is no evidence of the prosecutrix herself to support the findings of conviction of rape 7 So far as the medical evidence is concerned PW 6 Dr Rajendra Kumar has clearly stated in his statement that no definite opinion regarding rape on PW 2 Mukhtyaro can be given for want of FSL report and FSL report has not been produced in the present case There is no dispute on the point that PW 2 Mukhtyaro was having no injury on her private part when she was got medically examined and she was a married woman 8 PW 1 Indo Bai who lodged the oral report Ex P 1 on 10 1 1981 has stated that she was informed by PW 2 Mukhtyaro that accused appellant has committed rape on her but she has admitted in her cross examination that at that time she did not find her clothes torn up She has further stated that PW 2 Mukhtyaro is an innocent girl and her mental power is very weak 9 PW 3 Shishuguddi is the sister of PW 2 Mukhtyaro and daughter of PW 1 Indo Bai and she states that when she came from the field she saw accused appellant committing rape on PW 2 Mukhtyaro and when she made hue and cry her aunty Mst Kako and PW 4 Chandu Ram also came there and accused appellant ran away 10 PW 4 Chandu Ram also admits this fact that he saw the accused appellant running from the scene 11 PW 5 Kartar Singh is another witness who states that he was told by PW 3 Shishuguddi that accused appellant teased PW 2 Mukhtyaro and thereafter he went inside the house and asked PW2 Mukhtyaro as to what has happened and upon this she told him that accused appellant has committed intercourse with her 12 Looking to the above evidence on record and especially looking to the facts that PW 2 Mukhtyaro prosecutrix has not been examined in the Court she was patient of mental retardation on the date of incident she was married woman she did not receive any injury on private part or other parts of her body her clothes were not torn up there is no actual evidence proving that sexual intercourse in actual terms has taken place with her by accused appellant there is statement of PW 5 Kartar Singh that he was told by PW 3 Shishuguddi that accused appellant teased PW 2 Mukhtyaro the case of the prosecution cannot travel beyond the offence under Section 354 IPC as the prosecution has proved that accused appellant used the criminal force on PW 2 Mukhtyaro with an intention to outrage her modesty and thus the findings of the learned Sessions Judge convicting accused appellant for the offence under Section 376 IPC cannot be maintained and accused appellant is liable to be convicted under Section 354 IPC instead of 376 IPC 13 So far as the conviction of accused appellant for the offence under Section 450 IPC is concerned the findings of the learned Sessions Judge in this respect are maintained 14 Since the accused appellant is going to be convicted under Section 354 IPC instead of 376 IPC the argument of the learned counsel for the accused appellant that he may be sentenced to the period already undergone becomes relevant 15 As per the report on the back of the warrant accused appellant has been in PC and JC from 16 1 1981 to 30 1 1981 and apart from this as per the order sheet of this Court dated 7 4 2000 it appears that accused appellant was sent to jail and he was ordered to be released on his furnishing personal bond of Rs 2000 and two sureties in the like amount but he has not furnished the same so far Thus he has been in jail since 7 4 2000 In my considered opinion for the offence under Sections 354 and 450 IPC the period which he has already undergone would be sufficient sentence to meet the ends of justice and thus he should be sentenced to the period already undergone by him for the said offences 16 In the result the appeal filed by the accused appellant Bali alias Bahal Singh is partly allowed The conviction of the accused appellant is altered from 376 IPC to 354 I P C and he is accordingly convicted under Section 354 IPC in place of 376 IPC However his conviction under Section 450 IPC is maintained For the offence under Sections 354 and 450 IPC the accused appellant is sentenced to the period already undergone by him The judgment and order dated 30 4 1982 passed by the learned Sessions Judge Sri Ganganagar stand modified accordingly Since the accused appellant Bali alias Bahal Singh is in jail he be released forthwith if not required in any other case|28/02/2002|Rajasthan High Court|5

7|Banarsi Das And Ors vs Sagar Mal on 22 February 1929|JUDGMENT 1 This is an application purporting to be under Section 151 Civil P C in First Appeal No 358 of 1925 The prayer in this application is to be found in para 8 which runs as follows That considering that the judgment was not delivered for a considerably long time after the hearing of the argument and that it was possible to miss important points advanced in argument and considering the technical defect in delivery of judgment which makes it a nullity it is prayed that the case may be treated as undecided and may be re heard or in the alternative if the judgment may be considered to be a legal judgment it may be revised 2 This application is signed by a counsel who did not appear in the case and Mr K D Malaviya on behalf of Mr Muhammad Husain asked us to postpone the hearing as Mr Muhammad Husain was not in Court We did not consider that a sufficient reason for postponing the hearing when the counsel must have known that this Bench was constituted specially to hear the application today 3 The points urged by Mr Malaviya are that the judgment of this Court was not properly signed and delivered because according to him on 8th August 1928 the complete judgment was not read out in Court and was not signed by either of us on that date that under Order 41 Rule 31 Civil P C every judgment of this Court in appeal had to be in writing and had to be signed when it was pronounced and the Judges had to date it He further submits that under Ch 7 Rule 3 of the Rules of the High Court when a written judgment is delivered in an appeal it had first to be signed by the Judges who heard the case and only then could be pronounced by one of such Judges It is urged by Mr Malaviya that the non compliance of the rules in view of the affidavit filed by his client makes the judgment a nullity and therefore the case must be treated as not disposed of and an undecided case and therefore he prays that his client should be given an opportunity of re arguing the case before this Bench 4 An application was presented to Dalal J who was the vacation Judge on 14th August 1928 supported by an affidavit that the judgment had not been signed by us and that there was no judgment in the office of the High Court Dalal J directed this application to be land before one of us with an office report on the points raised in the application The office has submitted a report which is dated 14th December 1928 5 Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru who appears on behalf of the opposite party viz the appellant in the case submits that Order 41 Rule 31 and Order 20 and the rules thereunder do not apply to the Chartered High Courts when the rules relating to judgments were in force when the Civil Procedure Code was enacted He has referred to Order 49 Rule 2 and we accept his contention that in view of the fact that before the present Code was enacted the rules were in force viz the rules of Court of 18th January 1898 the provisions of Order 20 and that of Order 41 Rule 31 do not apply to the High Court He has further submitted that if the Judges had agreed to a judgment under the rules of the Court it was not necessary that the judgment should be signed by both the Judges before pronouncing the judgment It is necessary to state exactly what happened in the case The appeal was argued by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru on behalf of the appellant and by Mr O Conor and Dr Katju on behalf of the respondent The hearing lasted several days and at the conclusion of the hearing we reserved our judgment Thereafter we met in chambers several times discussed the points that had to be decided discussed the value to be attached to the evidence called both oral and documentary and we agreed to what the decision on such point raised in the case was to be There were really three points in the case The first question was as to whether the plaintiff had proved the pedigree he had set forward the second was whether the defendant had proved his adoption and the third point was whether Bhagwan Das and Hira Lal were members of a joint Hindu family As one of us proceeded on casual leave there was delay in writing out the judgment and on the 8th August the Court sat for the last time before the long vacation By a mistake of the office the case was listed in Court No 5 and was by an order transferred to Court No 1 The judgment on the first question had been typed out and contained the result of the joint consultation between us On the 8th August the note made by the officer of the Court whose duty is to record proceedings was as follows Judgment delivered today parties present appeal allowed judgment with Hon ble Banerji 6 Orally it was stated in open Court what was our finding on the two other points that we had to decide but the reasons for the decision of the second and third point had not been recorded The complete judgment was signed by one of us and then sent to the other for signature but on account of his absence from the station on duty the judgment was not sent into the office until 22nd August 1928 duly signed by both of us 7 It thus appears that although one of us had pronounced in open Court the joint findings arrived at by us the record of our reasons was not in Court on 8th August 1928 and the judgment had not been duly signed by both of us on that date 8 Rule 3 Ch 7 of rules of the Court in our opinion requires that when a written judgment is pronounced by one of the Judges it has to be signed by both the Judges but this in our opinion is a mere irregularity and does not in any way affect the merits and in our opinion Section 151 Civil P C cannot be invoked to ask us to re hear the case merely on account of a technical irregularity 9 The 8th August 1928 being the last date of sittings the office could not arrange that both of us should be sitting together to deliver the judgment orally It was for the convenience of counsel that in case the parties wanted to appeal to His Majesty in Council that we pronounced our judgment on the 8th to enable counsel to prepare the application for leave to appeal at leisure Although Mr Malaviya suggests that the judgment would not be illegal if we had the last page copied out and we signed the last page and then pronounced the judgment it appears to us that no useful purpose would be served by adopting that course There is no force in this application and we dismiss it with costs We assess counsel s fees for today s hearing at Rs 200|28/02/2002|Allahabad High Court|7

10|Ramakanta Mohanty vs Ajay Kumar Routray And Ors on 22 January 1993|JUDGMENT L Rath J 1 The question raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the direction by the learned Magistrate in a complaint case after recording the statements of the complainant and some witnesses to the police to investigate into the matter Under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter referred to as Cr PC is illegal as the power under the section vested in the Magistrate is to either enquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit but not resort to both the methods The petitioner filed a complaint before the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate Bhubaneswar alleging offences against the opposite parties Under Sections 342 347 348 384 465 109 392 354 34 IPC and during the enquiry held by the Magistrate Under Section 200 examined himself his wife and son as witnesses The learned Magistrate in his order dated 4 7 1992 held that clear evidence was not available regarding obtaining of signature and recovery of gold from the locker by the opposite parties and that such type of allegation can be properly appreciated if it is investigated by the police He accordingly directed the Inspector in charge of Kharvelanagar Police Station to investigate into the allegation made in the complaint and submit the report Because of the use of the words either and or it is clear according to Mr Mohapatra appearing for the petitioner that only one of the options is available to the Magistrate but not both The question raised by the learned counsel is no longe res Integra in view of the decision of this Court reported in Vol 33 1991 OJD 353 Criminal Mrutyunjaya Tripathy v Naba Kumar Misra wherein interpreting the provisions of Section 202 Cr PC it was held The words either and or in Section 202 do not mean that the options of the Magistrate are mutually exclusive in the sense that once he directs an investigation by some other authority he is rendered powerless to hold the enquiry himself Such an interpretation may result in stiffling of the very complaint since if either the police or any other authority to whom the investigation is entrusted does not choose to carry out the direction in spite of reminders and no report is submitted the Court would be powerless to proceed with the complaint and the complainant would be without remedy This could never be the intention of the legislature Hence the power is inherent in the Magistrate to stop the investigation which has been directed and instead proceed with the enquiry himself The matter was considered in 1986 Cri LJ 1266 Parasuram Jha and Ors v The State of Bihar and Anr where Sandhawalia CJ held that where alternative choices have to be given invariably the language employed has to be in the usual form that the person being given such discretion may either resort to one or the other It does not necessarily follow that he then cannot either resort to both or intermix the same and that the power so vested may include the exercise of both rather than necessarily exclude one from the other and that the more employment of the two words either and or cannot in any way be conclusive In AIR 1976 SC 1672 Deorapalli Laxmi Narain Reddy v V Narain Reddy it was observed that Section 202 comes in at a stage when some evidence has been collected by the Magistrate in proceeding under Chapter XV but the same is deemed insufficient to take a decision as to the next step in the prescribed procedure In such a situation the Magistrate is empowered Under Section 202 to direct within the limits circumscribed by that section an investigation for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding Thus the object of an investigation Under Section 202 is not to initiate a fresh case on police report but to assist the Magistrate in completing proceedings already instituted upon a complaint before him The view that the words either and or are not mutually exclusive to each other is also supported by the decision of the Allahabad High Court reported in 1987 III Crimes 379 Pulloo Jaidev and Ors v State of U P and Anr 2 The question raised by Mr Mohapatra being thus concluded to excution can be taken to the order passed by the learned Magistrate Mr Mohapatra has also cited some decisions namely AIR 1992 All 211 Emperor v Durga Prasad AIR 1937 Nag 389 Tyab Ali Yusuf Ali Bohari v Husainali Yusafali Bohari AIR 1949 Pat 36 Radha Kishun Sao v S K Misra and Anr 1975 Cri LJ 1367 Nagawwa v Veeranna Shivalingappa Koujalagi and Ors and 1981 Cri LJ 1002 Sankar Chandra Ghose v Roopraj S Bhansally taking the contrary view but in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court no support can be drawn from those decisions 3 In that view of the matter this petition has no merit and is hence dismissed|28/02/2002|Orissa High Court|10

14|Sheo Mangal vs Ram Charan on 1 April 1954|JUDGMENT Malik C J 1 The following question was referred for decision by this Full Bench Whether an Assistant Collector of the first class who is empowered by the Local Government to exercise all the powers of a Collector under Chapter III of the U P Agriculturists Relief Act can transfer a case from his court to the court of any other Assistant Collector empowered under Sub section 1 of Section 22 This reference became necessary as a Bench of this Court had taken the view in Sampat Kumar v Moti 1950 All WR 103 A that the power of transfer given to a Collector under Sub section 2 Section 22 did not empower the Assistant Collector to transfer a case pending in his court to another Assistant Collector empowered under Sub section 1 of Section 22 The decision of this Court was given on November 9 1949 while the U P Agriculturists Relief Act had remained in force from 1935 and during this period of more than 15 years a very large number of cases might have been transferred by Assistant Collectors purporting to act under Section 22 2 of the Act and two of such cases were listed on the same date before the Court which made the reference 2 In Sub section 4 of Section 2 of the U P Agriculturists Relief Act U P Act No XXVII of 1939 Collector is defined as meaning the officer appointed as Collector of a district under the Land Revenue Act No 3 of 1901 Section 22 1 is as follows The Local Government may empower any Assistant Collector of the first class to exercise the powers of a Collector under this Chapter Section 22 is in Chapter III of the Act and that Chapter begins from Section 9 and ends with Section 27 and only in three sections the word Collector is mentioned Section 10 provides that applications under this Chapter shall if the principal money secured does not exceed Rs 500 be brought before the Collector and the word Court in this Chapter shall in such cases include the Collector It is not disputed that if a notification has been issued by the Government then an Assistant Collector can entertain an application under Section 10 of the Act Section 23 the other section in which this word occurs is as follows An appeal shall lie to the District Judge from an order of a Collector or Assistant Collector passed under this Chapter The word Assistant Collector being also mentioned recourse need not be had to Section 22 and orders passed whether by the Collector or by the Assistant Collector are made appealable to the District Judge To come back to Section 22 Sub section 1 of that section provides that the Local Government may empower any Assistant Collector of the first class to exercise the powers of a Collector under that Chapter and Sub section 2 then provides that the Collector may transfer any proceedings under this Chapter a from his own court to that of an Assistant Collector empowered under Sub Section 1 b from the court of an Assistant Collector subordinate to him either to his own court or to that of any other Assistant Collector empowered under Sub section 1 If Sub section 1 Section 22 does not govern Sub section 2 of that section then Sub section 1 would only be necessary for empowering an Assistant Collector to entertain an application under Section 10 and it was not necessary for the legislature to have said that the Local Government may empower any Assistant Collector of the first class to exercise the powers of a Collector under this Chapter Mention of Section 10 of the Act would have been quite sufficient 3 If the words to exercise the powers of a Collector under this Chapter are given their ordinary meaning then wherever the word Collector occurs in Chapter 3 it would include an Assistant Collector and therefore the word Collector in Sub section 2 will also include an Assistant Collector On the other hand the learned counsel for the applicants has pointed out that there may be some practical difficulties inasmuch as an Assistant Collector empowered under Sub section 1 may not be subordinate to an Assistant Collector similarly empowered and it will be anomalous that one Assistant Collector should transfer a case from his own court to a court of equal jurisdiction He has pointed out that there is nothing in Sub section 2 which empowers a Collector to transfer a case from his own court to the court of another Collector 4 In view of the plain language of the section it is not necessary for us to go into these practical difficulties and it may be that in case of any practical difficulty the District Judge may be able in an appeal from an order of a Collector or an Assistant Collector to set things right The fact however remains that Sub section 1 provides that the Local Government may empower any Assistant Collector of the first class to exercise the powers of a Collector under Chapter III and the power to transfer a case to the court of an Assistant Collector is a power exercisable by a Collector under Chapter III There is no reason therefore why an Assistant Collector should not have the power to transfer a case Sub section 2 is a part of Chapter III and is governed by Sub section 1 5 The U P Agriculturists Relief Act has now been repealed and it will not be desirable to unsettle a large number of decisions by courts of Assistant Collectors to whom cases might have been transferred by other Assistant Collectors purporting to act under Sub section 2 of Section 22 Taking all these matters into consideration we consider that an Assistant Collector who has been empowered to exercise the powers of the Collector under Chapter 3 has the power in a proper case to transfer a case to the court of another Assistant Collector empowered under Sub section 1 6 The Rules framed by the Local Government are in these words The powers of a Collector under Chapter III of the Act are under section 22 1 of the Act hereby conferred on all Assistant Collectors of the first class who are in charge of sub divisions or who have exercised powers of the first class for more than five years There may be therefore more than one Assistant Collector in a district or a sub division who is able to take cognizance of an application under Section 10 and if for some reason one Assistant Collector of the first class has transferred the case to another Assistant Collector of the first class of more than five years standing there is no reason to think that there will be any practical difficulty 7 We therefore answer the question in the affirmative and overrule the decision in Sampat Kumar v Moti A mentioned above 8 The answer may be sent to the Bench concerned|28/02/2002|Allahabad High Court|14

23|Dayanidhi Sahu vs Sarala Dei And Ors on 24 December 1963|JUDGMENT R L Narasimham C J 1 These two appeals arise out of the same judgment and are disposed of together 2 Both the appeals arise out of the appellate judgment of the Additional District Judge Cuttack partially reversing the judgment of the Munshi 2nd Court Cuttack and decreeing joint possession of the disputed properties between plaintiff No 2 and the defendants 3 The suit property consists of a very valuable house site appertaining to Darpattadar Khata No 1349 in the town of Cuttack bearing plot No 2173 and No 2174 of Current Settlement 4 There was previous litigation in respect of the same property between plaintiff No 2 and defendant No 1 and some other defendants The judgment of the trial Court in that case was delivered on 29 4 1950 and the suit under appeal was filed on 8 5 1950 a week after the dismissal of the earlier suit That suit was taken up to the High Court on second appeal and the decisions of the two lower courts were confirmed by the High Court on 2 4 1956 In that litigation the main question for decision was whether the disputed property belonged to Kanungo Durgacharan Mohanty only or else whether his brothers had interest in the same It was finally decided that his brothers had no interest in the property 5 For the purpose of the present litigation therefore it may be taken as concluded that the disputed property belonged to Kanungo Durgacharan Mohanty The suit under appeal was brought by his son Kanungo Bishnucharan Mohanty through his first wife who was the sole plaintiff at the commencement of the suit Plaintiff No 2 claims to have purchased his interest in the suit house and was subsequently added as plaintiff No 2 Defendant No 2 is the second wife of Durgacharan and defendants 3 to 8 are her children 6 The said Durgacharan Mohanty entered into an agreement for the sale of the disputed property with one Prana Dhan Das since dead on 8 10 1937 Ex E and according to defendant No 1 put Pranadhan Das in possession of the property on that date Subsequently on 7 5 38 a registered sale deed Ex 1 was executed by Durgacharan Mohanty in favour of defendant No 1 who is none else but a daughter of Prana Dhana Das and she remained in possession of the same thereafter Thus according to defendant No 1 full title and possession over the disputed property passed to her 7 The case of plaintiff No 1 however was that the suit property was the ancestral property of his father Durgacharan that there was no legal necessity for the sale in favour of defendant No 1 and that consequently the plaintiff s interest was unaffected by the sale He even went to the length of saying that the sale deed was collusiva and fraudulent that there was no passing of consideration and that no title passed Hence he asked for a declaration that the title to the properties still subsisted with the plaintiff and with defendants 2 to 8 the widow and the other sons of Durga Charan There was also a prayer for confirmation of possession of those persons in respect of the property But there was also an alternative prayer that they be ordered to recover possession of the properties in case they be found to have been dispossessed Subsequent to the commencement of the suit as already pointed out plaintiff No 2 purchased the interest of plaintifi No 1 and also of defendant No 3 on 13 11 1956 and he is the main contestant in this appeal 8 The lower appellate Court held that the property was the ancestral property of Durgacharan and not his self acquisition and that consequently his sons also had a share in them He held however that the sale by Durgacharan in favour of defendant No 1 Ex 1 was genuine and that a substantial portion of the consideration money was actually paid But he also held that the sale was not for legal necessity and that consequently the interest of Bishnu Charan Mohanty in the property did not pass by the sale He further held that as plaintiff No 1 had separated from his father long ago prior to the sale he could not get the alienation made by his father set aside in its entirety though his interest in the property would be unaffected by the sale Hence he decreed the suit for joint possession between the plaintiff No 1 as the purchaser of the interest of plaintiff No 1 and defendant No 2 9 The main question of law argued before this Court is the question regarding limitation According to Mr D Mohanty appearing for defendant No 1 the property passed out of Duraga charan s family completely on 8 10 1937 when possession was delivered to Prana Dhan Das in pursuance of the agreement for sale Ex E by Durga Charan and as the suit was brought only on 8 5 1950 it was barred by limitation under Artice 142 of the Limitation Act Mr Panda for the contesting plaintiff urged that Article 126 of the Limitation Act would be applicable and that as the alinee namely defendant No 1 obtained possession of the property only on the date of the sale deed Ex A viz 8 5 1935 the suit must be held to have been filed within the period of twelve years 7th May 1950 being a Sunday 10 The concurrent findings of the two courts on the question of possession may be summarised Both the courts believed the evidence of D W 1 and D W 2 and also the partial admission of the plaintiff that Prana Dhan Das put his lock in the dilapidated house that was standing on the suit land on 8 10 1937 and obtained complete possession of the same D Ws 1 and 2 further stated that after taking possession Prana Dhan Das got the dilapidated house demolished took away the materials and exercised other acts of possession over the property such as enclosing it with a fence and growing vegetables for several years As these witnesses have been believed by the Courts of facts it must be held that the family of Durga Charan Das was completely dispossessed from the disputed plots on 8 10 1937 It is true that the sale deed Ext A was taken in the name of defendant No 1 who is none else but the daughter of Prana Dhan Das whereas the agreement of sale Ex E was executed on 8 10 1937 in favour of Prana Dkan Das but it is the evidence of D W 1 who has been believed by the two Courts of fact that Prana Dhan Das wanted to give the property to his daughter defendant No 1 and hence he got the sale deed executed in her name In that sale deed there is a recital to the effect that there was previous agreement for sale of the property by Kanungo Durga Charan in favour of Prana Dhan Das It was the plaintiffs case all along that it was Prana Dhan who was the real defendant in this case that he being a pleader s clerk and a veteran litigant he prevailed upon the plaintiff s father Durgacharan to transfer the property to him see paragraph 9 of the plaint Prana Dhan was also alive for some years after the commencement of the present litigation Hence for the purpose of this case it will not be proper to make a suitable distinction between the possession of Pranadhan Das on 8 10 1937 on the basis of Ext E the agreement for sale and the subsequent possession of his daughter defendant No 1 under Ext A dated 8 6 58 The evidence of defendants 1 and 2 shows that even after the date of sale it was Prana Dhan Das who removed the building materials from the site enclosed it with a fencing and grew vegetables For the purpose of this litigation it is unnecessary to say whether defendant 1 was a mere benamidar for her father Prana Dhan Das or whether Prana Dhan Das was merely acting on her behalf from the date of agreement of sale 8 10 1937 It is sufficient to say that the possession of Prana Dhan Das and his daughter defendant No 1 as held by the two Courts was continuous from 8 10 1937 11 It is true that in the plaint there was no admission of dispossession in respect of the suit plots though in the prayer portion there was an alternative prayer either for confirmation of possession or recovery of possession thereby admitting though somewhat haltingly that on the date of the suit the plots were not in possession of the plaintiff But in view of the concurrent findings of the two lower Courts that complete dispossession took place on 8 10 1937 this question is academic As pointed out in the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court reported in Bindhyachal Chand v Ram Gharib AIR 1934 All 993 the applicability of Article 142 depends not solely on the facts in the plaint but also on the finding of the Court on the question of possession I may quote the following passage at p 997 But where the plaintiff admits that he has been dispossessed by the defendant or at any rate it is found in the case that he has been dispossessed and is not in possession at the time he brings the suit then he cannot start with a presumption in his favour that possession of the property was with him See Badri Khatik v Narain Singh AIR 1946 Pat 185 and Chandiprasad v Awadh Narain Jha AIR 1952 Pat 143 12 Mr Panda s reliance on Article 126 of the Limitation Act seems quite futile That article says that the limitation of 12 years commences from the date on which the alienee took possession but there is no rule of law that an alienee s possession must be computed only from the date of execution of the registered sale deed It might commence even earlier on the basis of the agreement of sale on which the doctrine of part performance under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is based I have already shown that in this case no distinction should be made between the possession of Prana Dhan Das and that of his daughter defendant No 1 Hence even if Article 126 is held to apply it must be held that the alienee s possession commenced from the date of the agreement of sale namely 8 10 1937 It is true that there is a conflict of judicial decision on the question whether for the purpose of Article 142 adverse possession for 12 years by several persons in possession successively even though they do not claim from one another would bar the true owner s claim In Vennam Ramiah v Kusru Kotamma AIR 1922 Mad 59 Chenchurama Reddy v Ademma AIR 1949 Mad 673 and Ahmad Ali v Hata AIR 1939 Lah 217 which are all based on the observations of Kay Lord Justice in Willis v Howe Earl 1893 2 Ch 545 and it was held that for the purpose of Article 142 possession of successive trespassers may be tacked on A contrary view was taken in Janakinath Saha v Baikuntha Nath AIR 1922 Cal 176 based on Soiling v Broughton 1893 AC 556 where it was held that the possession of independent though successful trespassers cannot be tacked even for the purpose of Article 146 But this view is based on the assumption that the trespassers were independent of one another and there was some period of time however short between the possession of one trespasser and that of another during which period the possession of the true owner is restored But here the distinguishing features are i that defendant No 1 and her father Prana Dhan Das are not independent trespassers and ii the possession of Prana Dhan Das as against Durga Charan s family has been continuous and the finding of the two courts is that there has not been even a momentary interruption of his possession Hence it must be held that for the purpose of Article 142 the plaintiff s suit is completely barred by limitation As this was the only point raised by Mr D Mohanty for the appellant in S A 206 of 1962 it is unnecessary to discuss the other points involved in this litigation 13 Both these reasons in Second Appeal No 206 of 1962 is allowed and Second Appeal No 152 of 1962 is dismissed and the plaintiff s suit is dismissed with costs throughout to be paid to defendant No 1 by the plaintiff 14 There will be only one set of costs in both these

34|Ramesh Prabhudas Modi vs Collector Of Customs P on 23 May 1989|ORDER R Jayaraman Member T 1 This is an appeal directed against the order in original bearing No S 14 4 1208 83 Pint SD INT NTFD 749 83 dated 18 8 1984 passed by the Addl Collector of Customs P Bombay imposing a penalty of Rs 50 0007 under Section 112 of the Customs Act on the appellant 2 The brief facts necessary for the disposal of the appeal can be stated as below On the basis of an information search of the godown premises of the appellant was carried out on 28 12 1983 as a result of which 7 packages containing Video Cassettes and stereo radio cassette players valued at Rs 1 68 000 m v were seized from the loft of the godown The seizure was effected in the presence of one Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh Mukadam of the godown the paid employee of the appellant In the adjudication proceedings initiated by the Asstt Collector the appellant as well as the godown keeper Aboo Backer Shaikh were imposed penalties apart from confiscating the goods of foreign origin The present appeal by the appellant is only with regard to the imposition of penalty on him by the Addl Collector 3 Shri Arun Mehta on behalf of the appellant contended that this order so far as the appellant is concerned has been passed without any legally acceptable evidence Elaborating on this point further he contended that it has been brought out in the statement of the godown keeper as well as in the statement of the appellant that the godown keeper is having an independent key of the godown and he is looking after the godown The appellant visits the godown hardly for a few hours Even the initial statement of the godown mukadam does not inculpate the appellant as having knowledge of the storage of the goods in the loft of the godown According to Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh the goods were brought in by one Shri Rafiq who was known to him because he is to come to play cricket near the godown The appellant was nowhere in the picture and the appellant has also denied any knowledge about Shri Rafiq in his statement Even in the subsequent statement of Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh given on 12 1 1984 in reply to a specific query with regard to the knowledge on the part of the appellant Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh has clearly indicated that the appellant is not aware of the storage of the goods in the godown Even the appellant was served with summons on 3 1 1984 and in response to the summons the appellant appeared on the next day itself Even in the statement given on 4 1 1984 no knowledge with regard to the storage of the goods confiscated on the part of the appellant has been brought out This statement as well as the subsequent statement of the appellant are totally exculpatory The learned advocate took me through the various statements referred to above and challenged the Collector s findings to the effect that it is difficult to believe that the goods under seizure were stored in the premisses of the appellant without his knowledge from the evidence on record The evidences do not show any nexus of the goods under seizure with the appellant He also took me through the findings of the Addl Collector to show that the conclusions arrived at are only based on surmises and conjectures and there is no legally acceptable evidence either in the form of statements of the godown keeper or in the form of admission in his own statement He therefore prayed for setting aside the order 4 Heard Shri Prabhu the learned departmental representative on behalf of the department He contended that though the statements of the godown keeper as well as the appellant do not bring out the involvement of the appellant admittedly he is the owner of the godown where he is conducting his business His behaviour as is evidenced from his own statement is strange in that he noticed one Mulla and another in the godown and he did not bother to enquire about Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh and did not question their presence without the godown keeper This clearly indicates that all is not well with his conduct He also did not bother to make any enquiries after the seizure He did not appear before the Customs authorities excepting in response of the summons dated 3 1 1984 He also contended that the totality of the circumstantial evidences is adequate for coming to the conclusion that the appellant being the owner of the premises should have had knowledge about the storage of the goods The godown keeper is admittedly a faithful servant of 22 years and such a servant is not expected to store the goods without his master s knowledge He thus supported the order 5 After hearing both the sides and perusing the available records including the copies of the statements cited by the learned advocate the main question to be decided is whether the appellant had knowledge about the storage of the smuggled goods in the godown belonging to the appellant For considering his main issue certain undisputed facts have to be kept in view The undisputed facts are The appellant is the owner of the godown One of the keys of the godown is with the mukadam and was operated upon independently by him This mukadam by name Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh was the person presented at the time of search of the godown His statement was recorded on 28 12 1983 the date of seizure itself wherein he was personally questioned about the owner The owner s name and address were given by Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh No other question has been put with regard to the knowledge or complicity on the part of the owner of the godown No follow up action by way of contacting the appellant immediately or carrying out search of the residential premises appears to have been done Even in the initial statement of Shri Aboo Backer Shaikh no knowledge on the part of the appellant has been attributed According to his version given immediately after the seizure he received the packages from one Shri Rafiq who used to play cricket near the godown and he kept the cartons in the godown expecting that he would get some monetary benefits Even in the statement of mukadam he denies the knowledge of the contents of the packages He also says that this was the first time he kept the packages like this received from somebody Even in the subsequent statement given by the mukadam on 12 1 1984 to a pointed question as to whether the appellant was aware of the fact of keeping such contraband goods in the godown his answer was that he has not told his master regarding the storage of such goods In the statement recorded from the appellant it is observed that he has denied his knowledge about Rafiq the person who is alleged to have kept the goods in the godown He has also denied any knowledge about the goods The goods are found to have been seized from the loft of the godown It is seen from the statement of the godown mukadam as well as the appellant that none of these statements inculpate the appellant with regard to the knowledge of the storage of the contraband goods in the godown No other evidences have been brought out either in the form of statement or through any other document to establish any link of the appellant either with the goods or with the undesirable elements resorting to smuggling of the goods In the context of the aforesaid factual position penal liability has been fastened on the appellant viz on the ground that he is the owner of the godown and some of his behaviour is somewhat unusual and his faithful servant would not have stored the goods without his knowledge The findings of the adjudicating authority precede to inculpate the appellant mainly on the following facts The appellant was regularly visiting the said premises The mukadam was under the appellant s employment for nearly 22 years and hence his statement exculpating the appellant in his subsequent statement is not credible because he is a faithful servant The persons pointed out viz Rafiq Mulla are nothing but creatures of Shaikh s imagination Hence it is difficult to believe that the goods under seizure could have found their way in the premises of the appellant without his knowledge The appellant s explanation was that when he visited the premises on 28 12 1983 at 6 30 p m he found it locked and he did not bother to open the godown Likewise when the appellant visited the premises on 28 12 1983 the mukadam was absent and one Mulla and another were present The appellant did not ask them what they are doing in the absence of Shri Aboobaker Shaikh The appellant has also referred to Mulla s name in his statement as the person from whom he enquired about the whereabouts of Shri Aboobaker Shaikh Neither the appellant nor Shri Aboobakar Shaikh made efforts to produce this Mulla to clarify their stand in the matter It is also difficult to conceive that Aboobakar Shaikh being a trusted and long time servant of Modi would undertake a venture of storing goods in the premises of Modi without the knowledge of Shri Modi 6 All these facts discussed in the findings of the adjudicating authority can only raise a presumption or a cloud of suspicion When it is not disputed that the godown mukadam was having an independent set of keys of the godown and he was generally supervising the godown it is quite possiblethat the godown keeper would have accepted the packages without the prior knowledge of the owner If this possibility is to be ruled out there should have been an admission either from the godown keeper or from the appellant or by way of independent evidences showing the linkage of the appellant with the smugglers which could provide the circumstantial evidence for coming to the conclusion about the knowledge of the appellant In this case I find there are no such evidences On the contrary none of the statements inculpate the appellant No immediate action seems to have been taken even by the department to bring the appellant to the scene Even the summons was found to have been issued on 3 1 1984 which was responded to by the appellant immediately on 4 1 1984 There was no allegation that the appellant was absconding In view of these circumstances the appellant is definitely entitled to the benefit of doubt especially when the storage place is not in the open space of the godown but from the loft of the godown which cannot be seen even during daily visits by the appellant Moreover the

42|Ramanlal Nagindas Jariwala And vs State Bank Of India And Ors on 14 September 1982|ORDER N H Bhatt J 1 These two revision applications respectively by the original defendant No 4 and by the original defendants Nos 1 and 3 are directed against the order of the executing court in the Special Darkhast No 81 of 1971 pending in the court of the Civil Judge S D Surat The challenge is laid against the acceptance of the bid at the court auction the auction purchaser being the respondent No 2 Hitendrakumar Jashwantlal Jariwala The objection to the auction sale is based on the alleged irregularities and illegalities alleged to have been committed in the matter of conducting the auction sale 2 In the latter of the two revision applications Mr Sanjanwala has raised one neat question of law by recourse to Order 21 Rule 86 of the Civil Procedure Code His submission is that after having deposited 25 of the purchase price spontaneously the auction purchaser had failed to deposit the remainder of 75 within 15 days of the date of acceptance of the bid and this having been not done that by itself vitiated the entire proceedings and nothing further remained to be done in the matter 3 As far as the objections on the merits or the procedural aspect of the auction are concerned this High Court exercising its revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code would be loath to entertain them particularly when the objectionists had an opportunity to ventilate the grievances by having recourse to Order 21 Rule 90 of the Code On this ground I refuse to go into those questions though they were vigorously sought to be urged before me by Mr R A Mehta for the petitioner of the first of the two revision applications I make it clear that if it is legally possible for the objectionists now to agitate that question they may do so and I am not to be understood to have expressed any opinion in that regard here one way or the other The question of delay can be sought to be thrashed out by recourse to Section 14 of the Indian Limitation Act and the objectionists may invoke this provision and the executing court will consider it on its own merit 4 Coming to the main point about non deposit of 75 of the remaining amount of sale consideration Mr Sanjanwala whose arguments were adopted by Mr R A Mehta urged that provisions of Order 21 Rules 85 and 86 which are reproduced below provide for no extension The provisions are Time for payment in full of purchase money 85 The full amount of purchase money payable shall be paid by the purchaser into court before the court closes on the fifteenth day from the sale of the property Provided that in calculating the amount to be so paid into court the purchaser shall have the advantage of any set off to which he may he entitled under Rule 72 Procedure in default of payment 86 In default of payment within the period mentioned in the last preceding rule the deposit may if the court thinks fit after defraying the expenses of the sale be forfeited to the Govt and the property shall be resold and the defaulting purchaser shall forfeit all claim to the property or to any part of the sum for which it may subsequently be sold The learned Advocates M s Sanjanwala and Mehta submitted that the auction purchaser had made default of payment within those 15 days mentioned in Rule 85 and so there was no alternative for the court but to order re sale of the property In this connection heavy reliance was placed by Mr Sanjanwala on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Manilal Mohanlal Shah v Sardar Sayed Ahmed AIR 1954 SC 349 In paragraph 8 of the said judgment the Supreme Court has categorically ruled that the provision regarding the deposit of 25 by the purchaser other than the decree holder is mandatory as the language of the rule suggests The full amount of purchase money must be paid within fifteen days from the date of the sale but the decree holder is entitled to the advantage of a set off If the payment is not made within the period of fifteen days the court has the discretion to forfeit the deposit and there the discretion ends but the obligation of the court to re sale the property is imperative A further consequence of non payment is that the defaulting purchaser forfeits all claim to the property 5 A ratio of this judgment was followed by the Bombay High Court in the case of Uttamchand Milapchand v Balkrishna Ramnath AIR 1961 Bom 224 which is the judgment of the Bombay High Court delivered on 26 6 1960 and as per the judgment of the Full Bench of this High Court this is also the law of the land to be followed In that Bombay judgment it was laid down that the provisions of Order 21 Rule 85 as well as Rule 86 are mandatory in the sense that in the event of the auction purchaser failing to deposit the full purchase price within 15 days from the date of the auction sale the court will have no option but to order a re sale of the property This necessarily implies that the court has no jurisdiction whatever to extend the time for the payment of the balance of the purchase price as fixed under O 21 R 85 Where the auction purchaser fails to pay the full purchase price within 15 days of the auction sale there is no question of any irregularity in such a sale being waived on account of the consent of the judgment debtor to the time being extended in favour of the auction purchaser The ratio of this judgment is that even if the extension of time is sought for and is granted by the court even with the consent of the judgment debtor the rigours of the provisions of Order 21 Rule 86 of the Code latter part do not stand in any way mitigated Same is the finding of A D Desai J as he then was as per his judgment dated 28 3 78 in the civil revision application No 1088 of 1977 which was pertaining to the very parties and was pertaining to this very execution application In that case the auction sale was challenged on the ground that the trial court without jurisdiction had granted time to the auction purchaser to pay up the amount after the expiry of 15 days period The facts of that case appear in paragraph 1 of that judgment In that case the auction purchaser had deposited 1 4th amount of the sale price on 22 2 1977 and had to deposit the balance with the executing Court before 9 3 1977 On 7 3 1977 the petitioner there filed an application to set aside the sale On 8 3 1977 the auction purchaser filed an application Ex 154 praying for extension of time to deposit the balance of amount on the ground that under the law sanction of textile authority was necessary before the sale was effected Upholding the contention of the judgment debtor the learned Judge held that the court had no jurisdiction to extend the time and reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Manilal Mohan Lal Shah AIR 1954 SC 349 supra Had the matter been as simple as it was before the Bombay High Court in the case of Uttamchand AIR 1961 Bom 224 supra or in the civil revision application number 1088 of 1977 before this court in the year 1977 no difficulty would have presented itself The peculiar facts of this case present a unique picture In this case the bid was accepted on 12 3 1982 1 4th of the amount was admittedly deposited soon on the bid having been accepted The remainder of the 75 of the amount was to be deposited by the auction purchaser on or before 27 3 1982 Now it so happened that before the expiry of those 15 days period that is on 22 3 1982 the original judgment debtor Ramanlal Nagindas Jariwala filed the present civil revision application No 597 of 1982 in this High Court with a prayer to stay the proceedings for confirmation of sale and bid of the respondent No 2 in the special darkhast in question On behalf of the auction purchaser caveat was already filed and when the matter was called out before the learned Judge A N Surti J on 23 3 1982 an objection was lodged by Mr Mankad for the auction purchaser That seems to be the obvious purpose of filing a caveat application and appearing before the court on 23 3 1982 Mr Mankad in his affidavit produced on the record of the civil revision application No 710 of 1982 shows that he had invited the attention Of my brother Surti J regarding deposit of the remaining 3 4th of the purchase money to be made on or before 27 3 1982 and that under the decision of A D Desai J in the civil revision application No 1088 of 1977 already referred to above and which had arisen in the course of these very execution proceedings the executing court would not have any power to extend the date and accept deposit after the decision of that Civil revision application No 597 of 1982 My brother A N Surti J then passed the following order Stay of further deposit by the auction purchaser and stay of further proceedings It is the say of the auction purchaser now before me that the court despite the objection being raised on behalf of the auction purchaser stayed not only the further proceedings but also the deposit of the 3 4th of the remainder amount ol consideration and therefore this action of the court taken in the face of the opposition by the auction purchaser cannot now go to the detriment of the auction purchaser so as to upset the whole auction sale For the purpose of putting the record straight I state that the civil revision application No 597 of 1982 was filed only by the judgment debtor who was the defendant No 4 Ramanlal Nagindas Jariwala whereas the civil revision application No 710 of 1982 is filed by the original firm and Arvindlal Bhagwandas who were the defendants Nos 1 and 3 in the execution proceedings In the earlier civil revision application No 597 of 1982 the petitioners of the civil revision application No 710 of 1982 were however certainly parties though they might not be present before the Court on 23 3 82 the day on which this Court took up the admissional hearing and passed the above mentioned order 6 In the light of the facts stated above the only point that arises for my consideration is whether the Court s staying of even the deposit of the remainder of the purchase price by the auction purchaser can go to mitigate the rigours of provisions of Order 21 R 86 of the Code M s Sanjanwala and Mehta on the one hand asserted that as laid down in the earlier judicial precedents referred to above even the Court has no power to rewrite the provisions of O 21 Rule 86 of the Code and grant time On the other hand Mr Mankad for the auction purchaser and Mr G N Desai for the judgment creditor urged that for no fault or default of the auction purchaser the amount could not be deposited despite the auction purchaser s resistance before this court to the move of the original defendant No 4 that proceedings should be stayed These learned advocates urged that once the court stayed that part there would be no impunity It is evident that once this High Court stayed the payment of the remainder of the 3 4 amount of consideration this auction purchaser even if he had gone to the executing court with the remainder of the money would not have found the court to accept the same 7 It is conceded for the purposes of this judgment and even M s G N Desai and Mankad did not urge otherwise that the court has got power to extend the time but what they argued is that if the court stalls the payment and thereby makes the auction purchaser almost helpless in depositing the remainder of the amount they cannot be visited with any evil consequences flowing directly from the court s action In other words their emphasis is that this is not a case of default 8 In Oxford English Dictionary the word default has been defined as failure of something and failure is a noun from the word fail which from the very nature of things refers to some volitional act In other words the word default implies a volitional and deliberate act and if a man for no fault of his is not able to deposit the amount required to be deposited under Order 21 Rr 85 and 86 of the Code he cannot be said to have been within the sweep of a mandatory provision of Order 21 Rule 86 of the Code It is truism to state that wrong assumption of law and thereby consequential non deposit of or negligence in being ready with the money latest on the 15th day would be covered by the term default In the facts and circumstances of this case as said above it is evident that there is no case of any default on the part of the auction purchaser For reasons totally beyond his control he was prevented from depositing the amount and one of the principles known to law is that court s action when it is suo motu and not ad invitum cannot go to the detriment of a citizen In my view therefore the otherwise rigorous provisions of Order 21 Rule 86 of the Code will not be applicable to the facts of the present case because this is not a case of any dafault whatsoever This is a case where the supervening hand of the court intervened and no party can be allowed to suffer because of the court s order 9 It is to be noted that there has been produced on record the affidavit of Advocate Mr K N Mankad and it is on the file of the Civil Revision Application No 710 of 1982 at pages 12 13 He has explained that he had appeared by virtue of the caveat filed on behalf of the auction purchaser and that when A N Surti J was about to pass an order of stay of further proceedings of the Dar khast he had objected to the same on the ground that the deposit of the remaining 3 4th of the purchase money was to be made on Or before 27 3 1982 and that in view of the decision of A D Desai J in the Civil Revision Application number 1088 of 1977 supra in these very proceedings arising out of the previous sale the executing court would not have any power to extend the date and accept deposit Mr Mankad then proceeds to state on oath that A N Surti J proceeded to observe that in that earlier case extension was sought for by the auction purchaser whereas this time he Surti J was on his own staying the deposit of the remaining 3 4th amount so as not to cause injustice to the present auction purchaser 10 There being no counter affidavit to challenge the words of Mr Mankad and from the very nature of things what Mr Mankad stated on oath appears to be the possible picture of the time I act on that word and hold that there was a suo motu order by the court to stay not only the further proceedings in the matter but also to stay the deposit of the remainder of the amount which was to be deposited on 27 3 1982 11 Mr Sanjanwala had requested me that in view of the categorical ruling of A D Desai J and looking to the importance of the matter I must refer this question for the more considered opinion to the Division Bench of this court Had there been any shred of doubt in my mind about what I have observed above I would have very willingly referred the matter to the Division Bench but in my view that court s suo motu action takes the auction purchaser out of the charge of default which is a condition precedent to the further obligation of the payment of remainder of the amount 12 The result is that both the petitions are rejected Time up to 16th September 1982 and no further is given to the auction purchaser to deposit the remainder of the amount in the trial court Rule is accordingly discharged in both the petitions with no order as to costs Stay is also vacated in both the petitions A copy of this operative order to be given to Mr Mankad to day with which he can go to the executing court and deposit the amount In order to enable the petitioners to have further recourse in accordance with law the further proceedings except the depositing of the 3 4th amount of consideration are stayed for a period of four weeks from today|28/02/2002|Gujarat High Court|42

the spot map arrested the accused persons and at the instance of accused Ram Bhadra on 7 6 2001 seized a stone and a Danda kept under his cot In the Murg enquiry it was revealed that accused persons subjected the deceased to cruelty for not meeting the demand of a scooter in dowry and that on some 3 dispute on not allowing her to go to her parents house assaulted her as a result of which she died 4 After investigation charge sheet was filed in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Budhar and the case was committed for trial to the Court of Sessions Shahdol 5 On charges being framed accused abjured their guilt and stated that witnesses spoke false against them due to enmity They were falsely implicated No evidence in their defence was adduced 6 Relying on the evidence of Vidya Sagar PW 1 Pushpa Pathak PW 2 Kalpana PW 3 Hirawati PW 6 Chintamani Yadav PW 7 Suryakant Tiwari PW 8 Rajnikant PW 12 Dr K K Gautam PW 5 and the Investigating Officer M S Karchuli PW 11 learned trial judge held accused persons guilty and convicted and sentenced them as mentioned above 7 We have heard the learned counsel for the parties 8 Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that it was not established by the prosecution evidence that the deceased met with a homicidal death According to him she had fallen down from the staircase and contracted injuries which resulted into her death 9 On perusal of the evidence of Dr K K Gautam PW 5 it is revealed that on postmortem examination of the dead body of the deceased he found following injuries In cross examination Dr K K Gautam PW 5 admitted that injuries found on the body of deceased might have been accidental if she struck against some stone or fallen down from stairs 10 It is true that Dr K K Gautam PW 5 did not specifically state that the injuries found on the body of the deceased were homicidal in nature and expressed the possibility of them being caused in an accident but in our opinion it can be gathered from the nature of injuries that they could be homicidal also Since doctor is not an eyewitness for establishment of the fact that the injuries were homicidal or accidental in nature appreciation of the surrounding circumstances is essential 11 In the statement of accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure none of the accused stated that the deceased had fallen down from any staircase It was not even reflected from the spot map Ex P 21 drawn by Inspector M S Karchuli PW 11 that there had been any staircase in the courtyard On the contrary it was revealed from the spot map that the house where the incident took place was a Kachcha house having roof of earthen tiles Khaprel There was nothing on record to indicate that the house of the appellants was a double storeyed house 12 Suryakant PW 8 and Rajnikant PW 12 though in cross examination admitted that they heard in village that deceased had died by a fall from the staircase but they did not disclose from whom they heard it They were declared hostile Thus in the absence of any evidence on record to the effect that deceased fell from stairs coupled with the statement of accused wherein they did not say that deceased fell from stairs it cannot be held that the deceased suffered injuries by an accidental fall Therefore the natural corollary is that the injuries and the death of deceased were homicidal in nature 13 In Trimukh Maroti Kirkan vs State of Maharashtra 2006 10 SCC 681 the Apex Court observed that 14 Now the question before us is whether on the basis of facts brought on record the husband of the deceased viz Ram Bhadra only or both the accused would be liable for causing injuries to deceased The indication given by the Apex Court in Trimukh Maroti supra appears to be that where an accused is alleged to have committed murder of his wife and prosecution succeeds in leading evidence to show that shortly before commission of crime they were together in the dwelling home it has to be held that if accused husband does not offer any explanation how the wife received injuries or offers a false explanation it would be a strong circumstance indicating that he is responsible for commission of the crime Thus it appears to indicate the responsibility of the husband only and not of other members of the family except where there is clear evidence of their involvement In the opinion of doctor the cause of death of deceased was coma due to ante mortem head injury The head injury was a haematoma on the left side of forehead with black left eye On the basis of the evidence adduced in the case it is not possible for us to hold all the persons in the house including Deowati liable for causing injuries to deceased in view of the ratio of Trimukh Maroti supra However it can safely be held that the injury was caused by accused Ram Bhadra as his presence in the house stood established by the evidence of Rajnikant PW 12 Rajnikant though did not toe the line of prosecution but he stated that after return from the house of Ganga Singh in the night Ram Bhadra went to his house Apart from that from the evidence of Kalpana PW 3 also the presence of Ram Bhadra in the house is clearly established It is true that circumstances give rise to suspicion against appellant Deowati also but the 7 suspicion howsoever great cannot take place of proof Merely a single stray line appearing in the evidence of Kalpana PW 3 a child witness of 8 years that Deowati grappled with the deceased cannot be accepted because of it being merely a suggestion by the prosecution to which she innocently yielded 15 In these circumstances we are of the definite view that it has been satisfactorily established by the prosecution evidence that it was only accused Ram Bhadra who caused the death of deceased The evidence however does not appear to us sufficient against accused Deowati to hold her guilty under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code As such she deserves to be acquitted 16 Learned counsel for the appellant strenuously urged that the conviction of accused Ram Bhadra under Section 302 IPC is not justified as the origin or the genesis of the occurrence which resulted into the death of deceased has not been proved It is true that no evidence has been adduced by the prosecution to indicate under what circumstances injuries were caused to deceased There was only one injury on the forehead which was the cause of death There were some abrasions on the cheek and chin and a fracture of clavicle bone of the shoulder It can therefore be inferred that there must have been a scuffle between deceased and the accused Since accused did not offer any explanation for that and there is no evidence on record from which the exact situation under which the incident occurred can be gathered this Court is left with the option only to conjecture the probabilities It is also significant to note that at the time of death the deceased was carrying pregnancy of 32 36 weeks There was a full term foetus in her womb Therefore it does not stand to reason that her husband would take up in his mind to deliberately kill her The prosecution has tendered no evidence to establish motive on the part of the accused to kill his wife In these circumstances we are of the definite opinion that the conviction of 8 accused appellant Ram Bhadra under Section 302 IPC is not justified However since the act by which he caused the death of the deceased was done by him with the intention of causing such bodily injury to deceased as was likely to cause her death he is liable to be convicted under Section 304 I of the Indian Penal Code 17 As far as conviction of accused appellants under Section 304 B and 498 A of the India Penal Code is concerned from the evidence of Vidya Sagar PW 1 and Pushpa Pathak PW 2 it stands established that deceased Sonika was married to accused Ram Bhadra on 4 th June 1997 and she died a homicidal death in the house of her husband during the intervening night of 2 nd and 3rd June 2001 Thus it has been proved that deceased died otherwise then under normal circumstances in the house of her husband within seven years of her marriage The question now remains to be answered is whether soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for or in connection with any demand of dowry Vidya Sagar PW 1 brother of deceased deposed that whenever deceased came to his house she told that her in laws used to manhandle her and ask her to bring a scooter This demand was being made by her husband mother in law and father in law The evidence of Vidya Sagar PW 1 finds support from the evidence of Pushpa Pathak PW 2 mother of the deceased who deposed that for about one year after the marriage of Sonika her in laws kept her well but thereafter whenever she came to her house she complained that accused persons made demand of a scooter There is nothing in the evidence of these witnesses to indicate that the accused persons caused the death of deceased for not meeting the demand of dowry There is also no evidence on record to indicate that the accused persons harassed or subjected the deceased to cruelty for or in connection with any demand of dowry soon before her death 9 In Kailash vs State of M P 2006 12 SCC 667 the Apex Court affirming the law laid down in Kans Raj vs State of Punjab and others 2000 5 SCC 207 held 18 On examining the factual position in the present case in the light of above proposition of law we find that prosecution failed to establish that death of the deceased was caused in connection with demand for dowry that too soon before the death of deceased Since no nexus could be established by the prosecution evidence between demand of scooter and the death of deceased the provision relating to presumption under Section 113 B can also be not made applicable As such the conviction of accused persons under Section 304 B of Indian Penal Code cannot be sustained However from the evidence of Vidya Sagar PW 1 and Pushpa Pathak PW 2 it can be gathered that after the marriage both the accused persons had harassed and subjected Sonika to cruelty to meet their unlawful demand of a scooter Therefore their conviction by the trial Court under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code deserves to be affirmed 19 In view of the above discussion conviction and sentence of both the appellants under Section 302 34 of the Indian Penal Code is set aside Appellant No 1 Ram Bhadra is however convicted under Section 304 I of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years Conviction of both the appellants under Section 304 B 34 of the Indian Penal Code is set aside They are acquitted of that charge Conviction of both the appellants under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code is affirmed However in view of the old age of appellant No 2 Deowati who must be of around 70 11 years of age now and long lapse of time after the incident sentence of both the appellants on that count is reduced from 2 years to rigorous imprisonment for six months only It has been pointed out that appellant No 2 Deowati has already suffered custody for a period of six months therefore she need not surrender 20 Appeal partly allowed|28/02/2002|Madhya Pradesh High Court|45

present application has been filed by the Applicants accused persons under Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code for grant of regular bail The Applicants accused are charged with having committed offence under Sections 302 307 143 to 149 etc of the Indian Penal Code for which complaint has been lodged being I CR No 83 of 2008 with Dwarka Police Station Learned advocate Mr Kandrap H Dholkia for the applicant accused referred to the FIR and submitted that it is evident from the manner in which the incident is said to have occurred and the role attributed to the present applicants accused as none of the applicants accused have caused any injury to the deceased He further submitted that the other co accused are alleged to have caused injury to the deceased For that he specifically referred to the role attributed to each of the applicants accused herein and submitted that the applicant accused No 1 Arjanbha Rukhadbha Manek is said to have been armed with axe and he is alleged to have caused injury to the complainant and not to the deceased He further submitted that the complainant has been discharged and therefore at the most the offence under Section 307 of IPC could be attracted qua the applicant accused no 1 Arjanbha Rukhadbha Manek He further submitted that the applicant accused no 2 Derajbha Ajabha Manek is said to have been armed with stick and attributed with the injury to the complainant and the mother and not the deceased Similarly applicant accused no 3 Rukhadbha Ajabha Manek is said to have been armed with stick and is alleged to have caused injury to the complainant and the father and not the deceased The applicant accused no 4 Torubha Rukhadbha Manek is alleged to have caught hold of the complainant and the other co accused have given the stick blow Similarly the applicant accused no 5 Gagubha Ajabha Manek is alleged to have caught hold of the complainant Therefore learned advocate Mr Dholkia submitted that at this stage considering the role attributed to the applicants accused they may be released on bail Learned advocate Mr Dholkia further submitted that the other co accused having similar role have been released as per the order passed by this Court in Criminal Misc Application No 3097 2009 dated 9 4 2009 the copy of which is also produced on record He therefore submitted that on the ground of parity the present applicants may also be released Learned APP Mr A J Desai referred to the statement of witnesses and submitted that the incident is alleged to have occurred near the boundaries of the field where the applicants and the other co accused and assaulting party armed with weapons have assaulted for which the alleged affence is said to have been committed However learned APP conceded that the role attributed to the applicants accused in Criminal Misc Application No 3097 of 2009 is also similar to the role attributed to the Applicant accused nos 2 3 4 and 5 Heard learned advocate Mr Dholkia for the applicants and learned APP Mr A J Desai for the Respondent State of Gujarat Having regard to the gravity of the offence the nature of the offence alleged and the manner in which the offence is said to have been committed particularly when 10 persons armed with lethal weapons have assaulted causing death of the deceased is a serious offence Moreover the offences alleged are also under Sections 143 147 148 and 149 of IPC where the individual role would not be much relevant However since the other co accused having a similar role have been released as per order passed in Criminal Misc Application No 3097 of 2009 dated 9 4 2009 in the opinion of this Court the Applicant Nos 2 3 4 and 5 are therefore required to be released on bail on the ground of parity However Applicant accused no 1 Arjanbha Rukhadbha Manek who is alleged to have armed with axe and causing injury to the complainant by assaulting with the axe cannot be said to be on the same footings and therefore he would not be entitled for grant of bail on the ground of parity The present application therefore stands rejected qua Applicant No 1 Arjanbha Rukhadbha Manek Rule discharged qua Applicant No 1 However the present application stands allowed qua Applicant Nos 2 to 5 Accordingly the Applicant accused no 2 Derajbha Ajabha Manek Applicant accused no 3 Rukhadbha Ajabha Manek Applicant accused no 4 Torubha Rukhadbha Manek and Applicant accused No 5 Gagubha Ajabha Manek are ordered to be released on bail in connection with I CR No 83 of 2008 registered with Dwarka Police Station on their executing a bond of Rs 10 000 Rupees Ten

JUSTICE M E N PATRUDU CRIMINAL APPEAL NO 1267 OF 2003 T R Murugeswari Appellant Vs State by Inspector of Police Kombai Police Station Crime No 21 of 1997 Respondent This criminal appeal is preferred under Section 374 Cr P C against the judgment passed by the learned Principal Sessions Judge Madurai on 24 4 2000 in S C No 127 of 1998 For Appellant Mr S K Vellaichamy For Respondent Mr P N Pandi Durai APP JUDGMENT The judgment of the Court was made by M E N PATRUDU J The legality and correctness of the judgment of the learned Principal Sessions Judge Madurai in S C No 127 of 1998 is challenged before us 2 The facts leading to the offence are The deceased Jeyakumar married one Vijayalakshmi P W 2 and lived for some time Thereafter he developed illicit intimacy with the accused Murugeswari and started living in a separate house resulting P W 2 went back to her parents house 3 While so on 11 6 1997 on the date of the incident P W 2 came back to the village in order to attend the marriage of her cousin Knowing the same the deceased went there and met his first wife P W 2 and also his child and enquired about the family welfare This has been disliked by the accused Therefore she went there and quarrelled with the deceased as well as with P W 2 The accused uttered to P W 2 that if you want to see your husband see him right now from toe to head as you cannot see him alive from tomorrow onwards So saying she caught hold of the shirt of the deceased and dragged him to her house This happened between 8 30 p m and 9 00 p m on 11 6 1997 P W 2 is the direct evidence of circumstances 4 P W 3 a mechanic who is an independent witness and residing in the same village also noticed the same In the presence of P Ws 2 and 3 the accused took the deceased to her house On the same day in the mid night the occurrence has occurred and deceased was killed 5 The case of the prosecution is that the deceased sustained as many as 17 injuries and majority of them are incised injuries including penis was cut from the shaft of the penis 2cm from the perinial part of the remannent portion of the shaft The deceased died due to the injuries sustained 6 The entire case of the prosecution rests on the circumstantial evidence 7 Heard the learned counsel for both sides 8 The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has contended that the deceased is having number of houses and there is no definite evidence that the deceased was staying along with the accused on the date and time of the offence 9 We do not agree with this contention 10 The evidence of P W 3 is convincing and it had established that the accused and the deceased are living together on 11 6 1997 at about 9 00 p m and the accused took the deceased to her house where the incident has occurred P W 2 also supported this version P W 4 is the brother of the deceased and is living in the same village He has deposed that P W 2 who was staying away from the deceased has returned back to the village in order to attend the marriage and the same fact was learnt by the deceased and due to natural love and affection the deceased went and met P W 2 who is no other than his legally wedded wife of the deceased and also met his child Therefore the presence of P W 2 at the village on the date of incident is proved through the evidence of P W 3 as well as P W 4 and the accused is residing with the deceased is also proved 11 The quarrel between the accused and the deceased was established from the evidence of P Ws 2 and 3 On the same night the deceased was murdered in the house of the accused The utterance of the accused directing towards P W 2 that if you want to see your husband better see him right now as there will not be any chance for him to alive from tomorrow established her intention of eliminating the deceased and the reason for this is that she is apprehending that the deceased might go back with P W 2 and her child and he may desert her Therefore with the same intention the offence has been committed 12 Though the entire case of prosecution rests on circumstantial evidence the fact that men may lie but the circumstances will never lie cannot be ignored 13 In this case the incident occurred in the house of the accused where the deceased and the accused are residing together and the evidence of P W 3 has clearly established that he has last seen the accused and the deceased together and both of them went inside after quarrel and on the same night the incident occurred and the accused did not account for the incident Therefore this fact is sufficient to connect the accused with the crime 14 On the next morning the First Information Report has been registered by the police The learned Sessions Judge has discussed in detail about the other circumstances leading for the offence 15 The most important circumstance of last seen together alive is deposed by P W 3 and there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of P W 3 as he is an independent witness He is neither relative nor a friend of the deceased nor having any enmities with the accused Therefore the trial court has rightly believed the evidence of P W 3 and it is not fair for us to disturb the finding of the trial court 16 The medical evidence has clearly established that the death is homicide 17 Therefore we do not find any reason to disagree with the finding of the trial court either with the conviction or the sentence imposed 18 Accordingly the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant by the trial court are confirmed 19 The criminal appeal fails and the same is dismissed vvk To 1 The Principal Sessions Judge Madurai 2 The Inspector of Police Kombai Police Station 3 The Public Prosecutor Madurai Bench of Madras High Court Madurai|28/02/2002|Madras

55|Shri Dhar And Anr vs Udaibir Singh Judeo on 30 April 1928|JUDGMENT Bennet J 1 This is a second appeal by the plaintiffs appellants against an order in appeal of Mr Norton the learned District Judge of Jhansi dismissing the suit of the plaintiffs for possession of a grove No 704 of mauza Kuthonda in Jalaun District The sole ground on which the lower appellate Court has proceeded is that the matter is res judicata between the parties on account of previous litigation in the revenue Courts The previous litigation consists of a suit for ejectment brought by the present respondent Rao Sahib Udaibir Singh against one Mulu as his non occupancy tenant of less than 12 years standing The present respondent granted a lease to Mulu and in the same year in which he granted the lease he brought a suit for ejectment against Mulu That suit for ejectment was dismissed by the Assistant Collector but was decreed in appeal by the Commissioner on 12th July 1922 During the pendency of the suit in the Court of the Assistant Collector the present appellant applied to be made a party The revenue record is not before this Court but it appears to me that the Assistant Collector allowed the name of the present appellant to be added as a defendant on the analogy of the provision of Section 198 Act 2 of 1901 The plea of Mulu was that he was looking after the land as a grove on behalf of the present appellant who was his master Section 198 Act 2 of 1901 allows a third party to be added if the alleged tenant pleads that he is a tenant of that third party In the present case the alleged tenant did not plead that he was tenant of the third party but that he was the servant of third party It would also have been possible for the revenue Court to have added the present appellant as a party under the general provisions of the Civil Procedure Code Order 1 Rule 10 But whether the re venue Court purported to act under Section 198 Act 2 of 1901 or under the general provisions of the Civil Procedure Code I consider that Sub section 2 Section 198 would limit the decisions of the revenue Court in so far as such decisions concern the rights of the person added as a defendant That sub section states The decision of the Court on such question shall not affect the right of any person entitled to the rent of the holding to establish his title by suit in the civil Court 2 The next point to which attention may be invited is that the plea of the present appellants that they have the rights of a grove holder in this number as against the present respondent who is the zamindar of the entire village was not one of the three issues framed by the Assistant Collector Those three issues were 1 Whether the relation of landlord and tenant exists between the plaintiff and defendant 1 i e Mulu 2 Whether the land in suit is agricultural land or grove 3 Whether the plaintiff is entitled to eject the defendant meaning Mulu defendant 2 3 The third point to which attention may be invited is that the learned Commissioner specifically states in his judgment in appeal Regarding issue 3 I find that appellant is entitled to eject Mulu respondent 1 who is his tenant But he is not entitled under the Tenancy Act to eject Sridhar and Ramdin who appear to be trespassers and not tenants 4 It was argued for the respondent that on issue 2 the learned Commissioner found I find that the land in suit is neither agricultural land nor a grove 5 But such a finding in regard to the state of No 704 in the year 1921 cannot possibly be res judicata in the present suit which is whether the appellant had got the rights of a grove holder in No 704 in 1924 6 The fourth point to which attention should be directed is that under Section 11 Civil P C the issue which is res judicata must have been decided in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit The revenue Courts are not competent to try the present suit Therefore the finding of the revenue Court cannot amount to res judicata The learned Counsel for the respondent admitted that the finding of the learned District Judge that this suit was barred by res judicata could not be upheld He advanced the argument that the suit of the plaintiff appellant might be barred by estoppel because a decree if granted to him would affect the decree granted by the revenue Courts It appears to me that the decree granted by the revenue Court was merely that Mulu should be ejected from No 704 A decree granted to the plaintiff in the present suit would not in any way affect the decree granted by the revenue Court on appeal Accordingly I allow the appeal with costs and remand the suit for decision by the lower appellate Court on the other issues|28/02/2002|Allahabad High Court|55

The plaintiff claims that the copyright exploitation of the works is done by the licensing system whereby the plaintiff gives public performance licences to the parties who in turn give the plaintiff

pictures clips which can be seen and shared by the user over the internet space The said website of defendant No 1 not only includes recently released infringing material but also the material which has not yet been released or is authorized for broadcast through the authorized distribution channels 7 The features of the website are being described as that the user or visitor need not subscribe

made through the medium of advertisements being displayed on each webpage The whole business of the defendant No 1 is specifically depends upon authorizing free uploading and then distributing the

cinematograph works including the ones which are for new movies or upcoming movies distributing which the plaintiff earns its revenue and completes its cost of film making gets deprived due to illegal IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 4 of 132 dissemination of the songs cinematographs works by the defendants on internet whereby the defendants encourages and authorizes the

plaintiff has stated that in the year 2007 a non disclosure agreement was signed between the plaintiff and the defendants and thereafter there were in talks with the defendants whereby the defendants were called upon to take the licences from the plaintiff But the talks broke down and the defendants rather offered the plaintiff to go for registration of rights management tool programme by way of

No 2682 2008 Page No 10 of 132 a This court does not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present proceedings on the grounds The defendant No 1 is a foreign national and is carrying

tests laid down in the case of Banyan Tree Vs A Murali Krishna Reddy Anr 2010 42 PTC 361 Del The exercise of jurisdiction by this court would mean that the court is giving extraterritorial effect b That the suit is not maintainable as the prayers made in the suit are non specific and if granted it will impose impossible burden upon the defendant No 1 The plaintiff has failed to specify in respect of which works it is seeking injunction order and thus the suit is not maintainable IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 11 of 132 c The prayers made in the suit are open

about the facts which according to the defendants were not mentioned in the legal notice in the year 2008 and the defendants have clarified all the aspect work wise e The acts of defendants are those of intermediatory providing free of cost platform to the users without any actual or direct knowledge of the content being uploaded and has no role in selection of the content so uploaded The defendants have no control over the said content being uploaded as the portal of the defendants is such where it cannot exercise any such control f The acts of the defendants are those of

whereby the liability of the defendants shall be exempted by operation of Section 79 of IT Act 2000 g The agreements or the assignments which are placed on record by the plaintiff are defective The said agreement reveals that the rights of the movies vest with the producers and they have retained IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 12 of 132 the said rights including internet rights Thus the rights which are asserted by the plaintiff actually do not belong to the plaintiff h The defendants only provides a means for file sharing where the acts which are performed may or may not be infringing and thus mere providing of means is no infringement under the eyes of the law i The acts of the defendants are protected under the provisions of Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA of United States j The defendants have provided the term of use agreement with users which reads as under IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 13 of 132 8 16 Violates the privacy rights publicity rights copyrights trademark rights contract rights or any other rights of any person Thus the defendants themselves require their users to respect the copyright of the others and have all intention to remove the infringing content whatsoever from its website k The defendants do not derive the monetary gains against the advertisement in the user generated content The advertisements may exist on the same page as on User Generated Content but they are not really against the user generated content but against the licensed content l The defendant No 1 acts as merely a licensee of the user wherein it takes a limited license from the user to add delete or modify the content so that the same is befitting to its website to make it viewable But the said defendant does not have any other license to sell those works or make it public outside its services Vide clause 6 1 of the User Agreement the said defendant binds its users to grant it a limited

the defendants cannot thus segregate the infringing or non infringing works n The defendants have installed a notice and take down procedure in compliance of Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA of US same as earlier one wherein any proprietor who has a reason to believe that the copyrighted content has been posted on the website can issue notice and ask to take down the request and the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 15 of 132 defendants will immediately take the corrective measures to take down and remove the said content o The defendants have also provided three safeguards on its own The Hash Block filters prevents the deleted content from being reposted by taking finger print of the content The Take Down stay down contents also prevents the repetitive reposting of the file containing identical content Thus the said filter is also a useful identifier for preventing repetitive infringement The third tool has been explained by the defendants in detail which is as under The most powerful filtering tool that defendant No 1 makes available to copyright owners is the free RMT Copyright Filter The defendant No 1 allows any copyright owner to register for and use this tool at no charge subject to a single registration agreement A copy of the standard RMT Registration Agreement applicable in this behalf has been filed along with the list of documents To take advantage of the RMT all that the copyright owner needs to do is IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 16 of 132 register with the defendant No 1 and then create fingerprints of its audio or audio visual content using the free software that the said defendant makes available through its filtering vendor called Audible Magic The copyright owner submits the fingerprints to the defendant s filtering vendor with associated business rules e g the copyright owner can decide to block all of its content or rather allow users to post certain pieces of content that it is trying to promote Thereafter if the copyright owner instructs that all of its content should be blocked the defendant No 1 s RMT Copyright Filter will be set to block all content uploaded by users that matches the copyright owner s content This means if any piece of content is uploaded that matches any 30 seconds of the copyright owner s content it would be blocked the 30 seconds of matched content is the technical limit for the filtering technology If the copyright owner therefore submits fingerprints to the RMT Copyright Filter it can avail themselves of extremely broad copyright protection on its website Upon signing up for the RMT as well as signing Audible Magic s own short agreement regarding the use of its signature generation software the content owner need not ever part with its content to receive the benefits of filtering Rather the content owner need only itself create the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 17 of 132 fingerprints of its content by using Audible Magic s free software and then send such fingerprints to Audible Magic with appropriate usage instructions i e block or allow The defendant No 1 also periodically runs the filter retroactively over its website again at its own cost over all the content that has already been posted on its website Accordingly if content was uploaded by a user before a copyright owner was able to add it to Audible Magic s reference database of fingerprints the filter will catch such previously uploaded content and remove it Thus as per the defendants all these measures are nothing but safeguards to prevent infringement and sufficiently demonstrates their bonafides and non involvement in the infringing acts p The defendants have launched their India operations in December 2007 and immediately informed all the music companies about its right management tool so that the infringement can be minimized and the plaintiff cannot blame the defendants for its own reluctance to subscribe to such facility and for the resulting infringements due to its non subscription q That the interim arrangement recorded in the Hon ble Division Bench s Order dated March 6 2009 embraces the notice and take down protocol set forth as a legal norm in the laws across the world including the laws of India to deal with the issues of on line IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 18 of 132 liability Consequently the said interim order represents the only feasible answer to the grievance of the Plaintiff if found to be well founded in law and fact r The Plaintiff has made misrepresentation of facts that the defendants do not have any control over the content posted on their website by the users Further the defendants do not target Indian customers The advertisements that may appear along with the thumbnails are a result of an automated process carried out by a search engine which is term centric and not content centric 18 The applications came up for hearing from time to time and clarifications were also sought from the parties after reserving the matter for orders 19 Learned counsel Mr Amit Sibal appearing on behalf of the plaintiff has made his submissions which can be enunciated as under a Firstly learned counsel Mr Sibal has submitted that the acts of the defendants wherein the defendants have used the copyrighted works of the plaintiff without licence or any authority amounts to primary acts of infringement Learned counsel has placed reliance on the provisions of Section 51 a i of the Copyright Act 1957 herein after referred as to as Act and argued that the defendants are communicating the works of the plaintiff to the public without IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 19 of 132 authority or licence and thus causing royalty losses in addition to making the work available to the public which only owner of the work is entitled to do Therefore the present case is a squarely a case of primary act of infringement as provided under Section 51 a i of the Act b Secondly learned counsel Mr Sibal has argued that the present case comes within the purview of Section 51 a ii of the Act as the defendants by providing a space to the users and enabling them to communicate the work to the public for the defendants own profit are actually permitting the place for infringement for their profit which is an infringement prescribed under Section 51 a ii of the Act Mr Sibal argued that providing webspace to the user is amounting to permitting the place The expression place has to be interpreted to subsume not merely physical place or space but also space at the virtual world of internet It is also pointed by the learned counsel that the defendants has not in the pleadings contested that MySpace website is a place within the meaning of Section 51 a ii of the Act c Further it is explained by Mr Sibal that the defendants have not disclosed to the court that the defendants acts are not totally without consideration in providing the space to the users But actually the defendants have purely and largely have commercial IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 20 of 132 interest in operating this kind of arrangement As per Mr Sibal it would not be unapt to call this as purely a commercial model as the defendants are reaping profits from all the advertisers by putting the advertisements along side the sound recordings and the cinematographs works of the plaintiff By doing all this the defendants are permitting a place to be used for infringement for profit The same is an act of infringement under Section 51 a ii of the Act In order to support his contention Mr Sibal relied upon the following judgments f Learned counsel Mr Sibal vehemently argued that the notice and take down alternative which has been suggested by the defendants do not mitigate the wrongs of the defendants and is not a sufficient safeguard for an infringement which occurs on day to day basis This has been explained by Mr Sibal by informing that the new musical and cinematograph works are made from time to time as and when there are promotions of new movies The availability of the said trailors or musical works on internet would mean sharing the same with public at large Notice and turn down provisions which provides the aggrieved party to get the defendants to notice the already occurring infringement and thereafter the defendants remove the contents on internet The said procedure is inappropriate and does not remedy the infringement as by the time notice to turn down is given by the plaintiff to the defendants infringement is already caused whereby the works of the plaintiff are already circulated to the public at large Thus the procedure suggested by the defendants to first make the infringing work available and then to delete on request is IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 24 of 132 bad and puts to the plaintiff into irretrievable harm by causing infringement of each and every new work of the plaintiff and enough damage is already done prior to making such turn down request As per Mr Sibal the question has to be seen from the perspective as why the defendants should be at all allowed to cause infringement of the plaintiff works at the first place and more so when the said acts are the conscious acts where the defendants are also getting benefitted g It is also the contention of Mr Sibal that the defendants refuge under the safe harbor provisions of the law will not be applicable to the present case The present case is to be decided upon the existing legal position and the law of the land and not as per the US Digital Millenium Copyright Act The said act and provisions under the said act does not extend to India and neither there is any provision under the existing laws which provides such safe harbor provisions and in the absence of the same the discussion relating to the same in relation to infringement of the plaintiff s works in India becomes irrelevant In short the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA is not applicable to the present dispute By making the above submissions Mr Sibal argued that the plaintiff has prima facie case as there is no denial to the title of the works owned by the plaintiff and there are infringing activities IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 25 of 132 being carried on the internet without authorization of the plaintiff Further the defendants are doing the same deliberately and causing the plaintiff royalty losses The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff and they are more inconvenient in the event of non grant of injunction as their works are continuing to be infringed on internet On the other hand the defendants can still continue their acts without displaying the works of the plaintiff s on the web The plaintiff is put to irretrievable harm due to the illegal acts of the defendants and its extensive royalty losses due to the same and the defendants have nothing to loose except the illegal earnings arising out the infringing activities Thus as per the learned counsel Mr Sibal the present case warrants the grant of injunction as per the prayers made in the injunction application and the order dated 19 12 2008 which has been modified by the Division bench further records that the same shall not come in the way of the learned single judge to decide the injunction application and thus this court can conveniently grant and extend the injunction in terms of the injunction application 20 Per contra Mr Rajinder Kumar advocate appearing on behalf of the defendants has resisted the injunction application and also submitted that the present case does not warrant the grant any injunction IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 26 of 132 at all Learned counsel Mr Kumar has made the submissions which can be outlined in the following terms a Mr Kumar firstly submitted that this court lacks necessary territorial and personal jurisdiction to entertain and try the proceedings against the defendants who are carrying on business residing and personally works for gain in the United States of America Mr Kumar in order to buttress his submissions relied upon the following The present case lacks territorial jurisdiction in view of the well settled law by this court in the case of Banyan Tree Supra wherein this court has extensively dealt with the subject of jurisdiction in the cases involving websites The said case falls within the observations of Banyan Tree IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 27 of 132 Supra and thus this court does not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present proceedings Even if the web site of the defendants is interactive the same by itself is not sufficient to clothe jurisdiction upon this court The defendants web site which is accessible and available to all and sundry from any part of the world is not specifically targeted at users in India The Plaintiff has not shown or pleaded prima facie that the defendant No 1 purposefully availed itself of the jurisdiction of this Hon ble Court that the nature of the activity indulged in by the defendants by the use of their web site was with an intention to conclude a commercial transaction with the web site user since the defendant No 1 s services are completely free of charge and that the specific targeting of this forum state by the defendants have resulted in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within this forum court The Plaintiff has pleaded that the defendants web site is a highly interactive web site which not only permits users to access the contents thereof but also to subscribe to the services provided by the defendants by signing up for such services including the uploading and downloading of IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 28 of 132 videos available on the web site The plaint and the documents filed by the Plaintiff no where show that the defendants use of its web site is with an intention to conclude a commercial transaction with its users On the contrary the subscription to the services offered on defendants web site is free and does not involve any future payment Even for the purposes of Section 20 c CPC in order to show that some part of the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Hon ble Court by the defendants use of the internet the Plaintiff must show and prove that not only the defendants specifically targeted viewers within the jurisdiction of this Hon ble Court but also that some commercial transaction using the web site was entered into by the defendants with a user of its web site within this forum resulting in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the jurisdiction of this Hon ble Court No such material has been placed on record by the Plaintiff that the defendants have entered into commercial transactions with the users of its web site in Delhi or anywhere in India for that matter IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 29 of 132 Further the Plaintiff has sought to establish jurisdiction on the basis of certain print outs from the defendants web site to purportedly show availability of the Plaintiff s works on the said web site for public performances display and communication of the same to the public No details of the users involved have been provided anywhere in the plaint These print outs seem to indicate that the Plaintiff has set up its own people to access the defendants web site and engineer the search results to suit its convenience As held by the Hon ble Division Bench in the case of Banyan Tree Supra it would have to be a real commercial transaction that the defendants have with someone not set up by the Plaintiff itself The Banyan Tree Supra opinion further holds that if the only evidence is in the form of a series of trap transactions they have to be shown as having been obtained using fair means The Plaintiff in the present case has failed to aver in the plaint and place alongwith it any supporting material to Thus as per Mr Kumar learned counsel for the defendants this court lacks the territorial jurisdiction due to the above said IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 30 of 132 reasons and this court should reject the plaint or return it to be presented before the appropriate forum b Mr Kumar learned counsel for the defendants has argued by explaining the meaning of copyright in the cinematograph films that the copyright in any work can be infringed when the infringer actually indulge into the said act of infringement The infringement cannot occur for the acts which the said defendants may indulge in future or which are not even entered into occurrence It is the contention of learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff is seeking the general kind of injunction which is impermissible in law as there must be specific acts complained of for infringement to happen and the court to prevent those Mr Kumar has drawn analogy from Trade Marks Act 1999 wherein the language of provision under the chapter of infringement uses the wordings Likelihood of confusion which according to him means permitting the plaintiff to sue for future wrongs however the as per the learned counsel no such language subsists in the Copyright Act and in that event of the matter it is inappropriate for this court to consider the grant of injunction for the future wrongs c Learned counsel thereafter started explaining the working of the defendant s website by showing the technical background of the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 31 of 132 internet and how it emerged Learned counsel has taken pains to explain the meaning of the word internet by citing some English judgments Counsel has then submitted that the defendants website is premised on the newer and the latest version of web 2 0 which permits interactive interface with the users using it which includes media games songs pictures and other multimedia d Learned counsel further argued that the there is a difference between the infringement of the copyright happening in the physical form or the tangible form and the acts which are done in the virtual world of the internet which are not available in the physical form As per the learned counsel that makes a lot of difference As per the learned counsel there is a world wide debate over the management of communication on the internet There are two international covenants entered into by the countries who are members of World Intellectual property Organisation which are known as WIPO Copyright Treaty WCT and WIPO Performance and Phonograms Treaty WPPT Learned counsel argued that the court should consider the provisions of these two treaties though India has not even ratified these conventions in order to consider the provisions relating to communications made over internet and its impact Learned counsel in order to support his contention also relies upon the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 32 of 132 judgment passed by the Apex court in Entertainment Network India Ltd vs Super Cassettes Industries 2008 9 SCALE 69 wherein the apex court has expressed its opinion about the Application of International Conventions in India in the following words IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 33 of 132 e Learned counsel has argued that the defendants by providing online space to the subscribers enabling them to share media online is acting as an intermediary within the meaning of Section 79 of the Information Technology Act as amended in the year 2009 and the acts of the defendants are thus saved by the Information Technology Act 2000 wherein its acts are without knowledge of the infringing nature of the communication f Learned counsel further argued that this court should interpret the provisions of the Copyright Act and information technology Act harmoniously wherein the IT Act will come into play in the same manner as that of the safe harbor provisions of US statute which saves the liability of the defendants The argument which has been raised by the learned counsel for the defendants is that it cannot be said that on one hand the IT Act saves the intermediaries from the liability and on the other hand the same intermediaries are exposed to strict liability provisions of the Copyright Act Both should operate simultaneously and the safeguard under IT Act thus must also shield the defendants from the liability under the Copyright Act as well which is no different from its operations on the internet Learned counsel has further explained the preceding argument in detail by enumerating the working process of the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 34 of 132 defendants on the internet which establish that the defendants are no more than an intermediary who is doing this without knowledge and despite due diligence the content cannot be known to the defendants at the first instance Learned counsel submitted that defendant No 1 is predominantly a service provider intermediary providing a free of cost platform to its users and offering an interactive user submitted network of friends personal profiles blogs groups photos music video instant messaging services mobile services and videos It is further submitted that the said defendants do not directly upload any content on its website except for content that it licenses and creates which constitutes a very small portion of the content on its website but merely provides a platform to its users for uploading content under certain terms and conditions Thus as per the learned counsel for the defendants the acts of the defendants are purely of the kinds of intermediary and the defendants are just facilitating the space and cannot be held to be within the knowledge of the content which is being uploaded by third party unless the right holder brings it to the notice of the defendants g Learned counsel further submitted that it is not merely without the knowledge of the defendants but also impossible to monitor each IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 35 of 132 and every content which is being uploaded on the website The same is therefore the compulsion of the defendants while operating on internet as the internet portal is open to world at large and due to the nature of the portal which is such that anyone can upload anything The defendants being a facilitating entity cannot be held responsible due to its impossibility of monitoring each and every content over the internet unless the active participation of the defendants is established h Learned counsel for the defendants further submitted that the defendants are not gaining any monetary benefits arising out the user generated content But rather the advertising as per the learned counsel for the defendants is no doubt a business model of the defendants but is against the licensed content Further it has been argued that the advertisements may also appear automatically as the user types keywords and search for the same This is usually a part of Adwords which are in the nature of hints or options given by the search engines as and when the user asks any query from search engine The example of the same is given that supposingly if the user is typing Punjaban The song may appear and along side the same some options of Punjabi matrimonial may appear automatically which happens due to the search engines exercise and not due to the acts of the defendants IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 36 of 132 j Learned counsel submitted that indeed it is correct that the defendants takes the licence from the user to use add delete from or publicly perform or publicly display publicly perform reproduce and distribute the said content for the purposes of the website However the said licence is a precautionary step to avoid any objection from any users of the defendants Learned counsel also states that the same does not mean that the defendants requires the licence for such reformatting k Learned counsel for the defendants further submitted that the defendants have already ensured that its website has measures to remove or prevent copyright infringements The said measures are taken in consonance with the Digitial Millennium Copyright Act of USA The said procedure is explained by the defendants below Accordingly if a copyright owner believes that his or her work has been copied and posted on the Defendant No 1 s website in such a way that constitutes copyright infringement the Defendant No 1 has provided information in the Frequently Asked Question FAQ section on its website to enable the copyright owner to file an infringement notice Towards this end the Defendant No 1 has provided details of its copyright agent in the User Agreement so that such copyright agent may be IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 37 of 132 notified of the claim of infringement consisting of the following information i an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest ii a description of the copyrighted work that the copyright owner claims to have been infringed iii a description of where the material that the copyright owner claims to have been infringed is located on the said Defendant s website providing the URLs of the claimed infringing material iv the address telephone number and email address of the copyright owner v a written statement by the copyright owner that he she has a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law vi a statement by the copyright owner that the above information in its notice is accurate and under penalty of perjury that he she is the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner s behalf The defendant No 1 also automatically and at its own initiative and expense takes two additional steps to hinder users from reposting that same content The defendants records the hash of the file that has been removed which is a unique identifier for that file The defendants also create a fingerprint of the content that has been removed which is a unique identifier for the content The defendant No 1 uses both the hash and the fingerprint to achieve the goal of preventing the same content that has been removed from being re posted After a copyright owner requests that user posted content be removed from the defendant No 1 s website it automatically adds the hash to the Hash Block IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 38 of 132 filter and fingerprint to the Take Down Stay Down Filter If any user tries to repost the same exact file it should be blocked by the Hash Block Filter which will recognize the same file If any user tries to repost the identical content even if the file is different because the content comes from a different source the Take Down Stay Down filter will recognize the identical content and block it from being reposted These are both precise filters because the goal is to take the copyright owner s specific take down request and apply it prospectively to all new content being posted Copyright owners often have policies to allow users to post shorter pieces of content but not the entire piece of content Further certain content may be protected under fair dealing protections or authorized by copyright owners themselves In such situations the defendant No 1 does not presume to know what the copyright owner might want done with different or shorter portions of the content But for content that the copyright owner has already removed the Take Down Stay Down Filter will automatically block any new content that the filter recognizes as the identical content The defendant No 1 employs these two filters automatically after receiving a take down request from a copyright owner and the copyright owner need not take any action on its own to get the benefits of these two filters IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 39 of 132 The most powerful filtering tool that defendant No 1 makes available to copyright owners is the free RMT Copyright Filter The defendant No 1 allows any copyright owner to register for and use this tool at no charge subject to a single registration agreement A copy of the standard RMT Registration Agreement applicable in this behalf has been filed to take advantage of the RMT all that the copyright owner needs to do is register with the defendant No 1 and then create fingerprints of its audio or audio visual content using the free software that the said defendant makes available through its filtering vendor called Audible Magic The copyright owner submits the fingerprints to the defendants filtering vendor with associated business rules e g the copyright owner can decide to block all of its content or rather allow users to post certain pieces of content that it is trying to promote Thereafter if the copyright owner instructs that all of its content should be blocked the defendant No 1 s RMT Copyright Filter will be set to block all content uploaded by users that matches the copyright owner s content This means if any piece of content is uploaded that matches any 30 seconds of the copyright owner s content it would be blocked the 30 seconds of matched content is the technical limit for the filtering technology If the copyright owner therefore submits fingerprints to the RMT IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 40 of 132 Copyright Filter it can avail itself of extremely broad copyright protection on its website Upon signing up for the RMT as well as signing Audible Magic s own short agreement regarding the use of its signature generation software the content owner need not ever part with its content to receive the benefits of filtering Rather the content owner need only itself create the fingerprints of its content by using Audible Magic s free software and then send such fingerprints to Audible Magic with appropriate usage instructions i e block or allow The defendant No 1 also periodically runs the filter retroactively over its website again at its own cost over all content that has already been posted to its website Accordingly if content was uploaded by a user before a copyright owner was able to add it to Audible Magic s reference database of fingerprints the filter will catch such previously uploaded content and remove it 21 Learned counsel states that once the defendants themselves vigilant about the right holders right and at their own expense are operating the measures to cure or filter the infringement In these circumstances the defendants cannot be said to be those who are indulging in the infringement when they have no connection whatsoever with the content of the works in question IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 41 of 132 22 By making these aforementioned submissions Mr Rajinder Kumar resisted the grant of injunction and also pressed for the vacation of the earlier order of Division bench by urging that the defences raised above prima facie establish that the defendants could not be held liable for any act of infringement of the copyright being an intermediary The defendants already have a provision to remedy the grievance of the plaintiff which does not require any further orders as it is within the policy of operation of the defendants that it is required to delete the works which are infringing in nature Further the said acts are without knowledge sufficiently are not covered by the second part of the provision of Section 51 a ii read with the provisions of IT Act and therefore no liability of infringement can be attributed against the defendants Thus the order passed by Division Bench is liable to vacated and injunction application filed by the plaintiff is to be dismissed Although during the course of the arguments the defendants counsel admitted that the order passed by the division bench can be confirmed and the same is also stated to be the only answer in the written statement 23 I have gone through the plaint written statement and records of the proceedings and also noted the submissions of the parties However before commenting upon the submissions of the parties I deem it fit to first discuss the law on the subject IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 42 of 132 Law Relating To Copyright And Its Relation With Internet Computing 24 Copyright is a bundle of rights which is meant to encourage creativity The said rights are negative rights in as much as the same are prohibiting others from using the copyrighted works The traditional concept of the copyright has undergone a drastic change as traditionally the law relating to copyright was meant to encourage the original literary books and also to help the poor authors But due to advent of the new technologies its scope has extended manifolds Now the modern law of copyright encompasses musical works cinematograph works computer programs performers rights broadcasting rights 24 1 The copyright has now become part of the business of the big organization more specifically in film industry where the major chunk of money is reaped out of the royalties arising out of the licensing and assignment of copyrights in the respective works Rather it would not be out of place to state that the royalties have become the backbone of the film making machinery The companies like the plaintiff and other musical companies on one side earning royalities and thereon investing the same funds in making the films 24 2 One more stage of complexity has been attained by the copyright law due to emergence of the virtual world of internet The internet computing has also brought many changes in our lives in stages IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 43 of 132 The era in 1990s saw the beginning of the computing internet wherein the TCPIP internet and windows interface which was so user friendly due to which we became conversant with the emails and network navigation Thereafter in the year 2000 and later the type of computing changed and it has been refined and set the benchmarks there has been a sudden rise in the markets of software be it accounting designing photo printing office using like notepads gaming chatting user to user protocol music sharing programs like napster kazaa etc All these software development have further taught us that there is much more than emails and typing on the computer and internet is very vast by which one can navigate in several spheres of subjects and can share the data with other users 24 3 The third and more advance stage of computing which we are witnessing at this stage is the one wherein the level of internet computing is established and there is a tendency to conduct business online There is a large segment of business models which are growing over the internet wherein the users are participating actively and thereon the companies are earning solely on the basis of the internet services by facilitating users to share their contents which are attractive which includes pictures motion pictures films songs graphics trailors private communications amongst the eminent personalities scam disclosures etc so as to make it common to all and enabling them to view it easily by sitting at home The more prominent examples of this advance stage is utube myspace IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 44 of 132 facebook etc This is really an advance stage and there is no hesitation in saying that it is a remarkable development wherein one can see motion pictures with high quality graphics on internet which includes filming and other mode of entertainment 24 4 While facilitating the said sharing process over the internet the companies like the defendants are gaining business in the nature of advertising sponsorships other like businesses which makes them popular and run their show This can be said to be one more way of conducting business which is comparatively new in its field The problem however crept in when the content which is a subject matter of sharing on the website operated by the companies are someone else s copyright or proprietary material and not owned by the person or the user supplying them The question then arises as to whether the said company by providing the medium of sharing to the users and also gaining commercially alongside the same can be said to have infringed the copyright of the right holder This court is faced with the similar kind of situation wherein the defendants said website operator and the plaintiff is the right holder and the court is called upon to answer the said question by applying the copyright law accordingly to this another mode of doing business which has been innovated by the defendants in the virtual world of internet IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 45 of 132 25 Copyright and its meaning has been provided under Section 13 and 14 of the Act The infringement of the copyright has been defined under Section 51 of the Act The said provisions are reproduced hereinafter for the ease of reference i does anything the exclusive right to do which is by this Act conferred upon the owner of the copyright or IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 49 of 132 ii permits for profit any place to be used for the communication of the work to the public where such communication constitutes an infringement of the copyright in the work unless he was not aware and had no reasonable ground for believing that such communication to the public would be an infringement of copyright or b When any person i makes for sale on hire or sells or lets for hire or by way of trade displays or offers for sale or hire or ii Distributes either for the purposes of trade or to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright or iii By way of trade exhibits in public or iv Imports into India any infringing copies of the work Provided that nothing in sub clause iv shall apply to the import of one copy of any work for the private and domestic use of the importer Explanation For the purposes of this section the reproduction of a literary dramatic musical or artistic work in the form of a cinematograph film shall be deemed to be an infringing copy 26 From the bare reading of the Section 51 it becomes apparent that the infringement is doing of any act by a person who is not authorized by the owner which the owner is conferred to do under the provisions of the Act or permitting any place for profit for infringement of the copyright is also an infringement under the Act The said two provisions are disjunctive in as much as that there shall be an IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 50 of 132 infringement even if the acts are done which are of the owner or in the alternative the acts of permitting any place for profit 27 At this stage it becomes relevant also to examine that the wordings of Section 51 a ii which provide permitting any place for profit The use of the words any place would include common public place or library or any other kind of place The wordings do not put any embargo of the kind of the place which is required to be permitted for profit in order to establish an infringement But rather the wordings used in the sub section are any place so as to subsume physical place or place at the internet or webspace The reference is invited to the provisions of UK Copyright Act 1956 which are similar in nature to Indian Copyright Act in this respect which brings more clarity on this aspect The said provisions are reproduced hereinafter 28 I am also comparing the provisions of UK Copyright Act 1988 CDPA which has been passed in the year 1988 repealing the earlier law The said provisions are 29 By comparing the situation as exists in 1956 Act of UK and 1957 Act of India in the provisions it becomes amply clear that the wordings used in the Section of UK Act are place of public entertainment but in Indian Act the wordings used are any place which reflects the intention of the legislature which is to provide a IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 53 of 132 provision for permissive infringement wherein it is not merely a place of public entertainment which is included but any place wherein the infringement is facilitated would be covered by the provision of the Indian Copyright Act 1957 30 The situation becomes more clear as one further sees carefully the later enactment of same nature in the UK CDPA Act of 1988 which provides two kinds of infringements separately which are that the place of public entertainment and infringement caused by use of an apparatus This fine distinction which is present in the later Act of UK is not present in the Indian Act This would demonstrate that UK legislature was conscious about the kinds of the infringement which are going to be caused in the light of the development in the technology and mere provision of facilitating the infringement at public place of entertainment would not sufficiently cover the protection and the apparatus infringement must be provided separately under the separate head Therefore in the light of the same the provision relating to providing means by way of apparatus is further introduced in addition to the already existing provision which relates to infringement relates to place of public entertainment in the 1988 Act 31 In the sharp contrast our Indian Act which has been amended number of times i e in 1984 1994 1999 which although provided for several crucial amendments including computer programmes as a subject IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 54 of 132 of copyright under the head of literary work but has not provided any separate infringement by way of an apparatus under the separate head or separately and the provision relates to the facilitating infringement is the same as it stood in the 1957 Act In absence of such amendment in the Indian Act and in view of the loosely worded provision which is any place the same can be given a wider connotation so as to include the place on the internet not confining it to place of entertainment but to extend it to other places also 32 It is now well settled that when there are new technological inventions or change in circumstances which was not in contemplation at the time when the statute was enacted the said invention or technological advancement may be included in the same enactment if they are falling within the same genus provided in the existing enactment 33 The reference in this respect is invited to the decision of House of Lords in Comdel Commodities Ltd vs Siporex Trade SA 1990 2 All ER 552 wherein Lord Bridge has said When a change in social conditions produces a novel situation which was not in contemplation at the time when a statute is first enacted there can be no a priori assumption that the enactment does not apply to the new circumstances If the language of the enactment is wide enough to extend to those circumstances there is no reason why it should not apply IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 55 of 132 On the same principles general words are construed as to include new inventions and technological advances not known at the time when the act was passed The Photograph copy is held to be a copy under the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 in the case of Gambart v Ball 1863 32 LJCP 166 Similarly telephone was not invented in 1869 even then the telephone was held to be a telegraph under the provisions of Telegraphs Act 1863 in the case of A G vs Edison Telephone Co of London 1880 6 QBD 244 referred in The Senior Electric Inspector vs Laxminarayan Chopra Ors AIR 1962 SC 159 34 More Recently Hon ble Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra vs Praful B Desai Dr 2003 4 SCC 601 has accepted the evidence by way of video conferencing as a valid one where the person being tried will satisfy the requirement of Section 273 of Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 when the technique of video conferencing was not even developed 35 In view of the same and also the fact that the provision provides for permitting any place which itself is loosely worded and is unfettered by any qualification the said words any place have to be construed widely so as to include the place at the webspace or internet in order to give effect to the provision to be operative in cases of newer kind of the infringements being caused at the webspace IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 56 of 132 36 This is more so in the absence of the specific provision relating to infringement by way of apparatus the law in that situation cannot remain static witnessing the infringements which can be otherwise covered under the Act The provisions which can conveniently cover the said acts must also be interpreted to include those new acts to make the provision workable for the newer kinds of infringement to the extent the wordings permit so Therefore the wordings any place under Section 51 a ii of the Act includes the place at the webspace in order to cover the infringements or the wrongs caused at the webspace 37 The proposition which emerges from the above discussion is that there is an express provision under the Act which prohibits a person from permitting any place including webspace for profit unless the said person is having no knowledge or reason to believe that the communication of the work is infringing in nature 38 There is however another way of approaching the similar kind of proposition which is popularly known as infringement by way of authorization This is done by interpreting Section 51 a i read with Section 14 of the Act The said Sections are reproduced hereinafter a When any person without a licence granted by the owner of the Copyright or the Registrar of Copyrights under this Act or in contravention of the conditions of a licence so granted or of any IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 57 of 132 conditions imposed by a competent authority under this Act i does anything the exclusive right to do which is by this Act conferred upon the owner of the copyright or 14 Meaning of copyright For the purposes of this Act copyright means the exclusive right subject to the provisions of this Act to do or authorise the doing of any of the following acts in respect of a work or any substantial part thereof namely a In the case of a literary dramatic or musical work not being a computer programme 39 By reading these provisions together it can be seen doing the acts of owner of copyright without permission or licence amounts to infringement The acts of owner are defined under Section 14 which include doing or authorize doing the acts Thus by virtue of conjoint reading one can say that the infringement of copyright can also be in the cases where there are acts of authorizing the infringement by anyone without permission 40 The said concept of authorizing the infringement has been succinctly discussed by Copinger Skone James on Copyright Fourteenth Edition by Kevin Garnett M A Jonathan R James MA LLB Gillian Davies Ph D 1999 Edition London Sweet Maxwell who is an authority on the subject in the following words 41 It is noteworthy to mention that the said concept of authorizing the infringement although looks akin to Section 51 a ii of the Act but the said authorization does not coincide with the permitting the place for profit The concept of authorizing the infringement is rather bigger and cannot be equated with merely facilitating the place for profit which is the express provision of the law which may be said to be one its facets The act of authorizing is something more than merely providing means with knowledge and require further active participation of the person than that of the permitting the place for infringement This is due to the reason that the grant of means to an infringement is different than the granting the right to do the act of infringement 41 1 Sometimes the infringement is not done directly but is done indirectly by the authority of some person for instance where a person handovers a pirated CD to a friend and also asks him to make number of copies and sell them to the public on behalf of the former In that IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 59 of 132 situation the former is authorizing infringement which he is doing through another person Both are parties to an infringement due to their direct or active involvement In this example the person retains his control where he can say to his friend to do or not to do the same on his behalf Besides that the former person also has knowledge about the pirated nature of the CD which is also relevant Thus it is an authorization and it is not merely providing a means for infringement but rather more than the same which is doing the infringement along with the co infringer or under the authority of a person 41 2 The act of authorizing infringement is premised on the concept of joint tort feasors wherein the person is held liable for commission of equal wrong when there is apparent clear establishment of his involvement in the wrong along with the other person committing the same The active participation inducement approval or countenance are thus necessary ingredients of authorization may not be sine qua non for the establishment of permission of place for profit The knowledge of the fact that the acts are going to be infringing is again different from the active participation or any kind of inducement 41 3 The knowledge is the starting point for authorization which is going to be established unless the clear active participation or reasonable degree of control is proved besides knowledge But on the other hand the same may not be true with permitting the place for profit wherein there is IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 60 of 132 only knowledge which is sufficient and the further state of affairs may remain irrelevant Therefore the onus of proof for establishing the authorization is more onerous than that of the establishing facilitation for profit 41 4 This distinction between the two concepts is necessary in order to better comprehend the subject which will make the evaluation of arguments raised by the parties easier 42 Now I shall deal with the contentions of the parties raised by them relating to the authorization and the applicability of Section 51 a ii of the Act 43 It is the contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the acts of providing the space over the internet and thereafter continuously doing the same ever after coming to know about the plaintiff s proprietary interests amounts to authorization as the defendants are aware that the said space is going to be used for infringement purposes As per the learned counsel the said acts become authorization as the defendants retain the control and power to further distribute or communicate the work to the public The said thing is done by the defendants with knowledge coupled with that of its own participation wherein it is offering the works of the plaintiff to the public at large by enlisting the works of the defendants in their search engine in such a way that when someone types the name of a song or a movie the same is easily IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 61 of 132 available on the search results Mr Sibal has narrated the factors by which the defendants are authorizing the infringement which can be enumerated as under a The defendants provide a search facility which enables anyone who visits its website to locate audio visual or audio files amongst those uploaded by other users which files are copied by the defendants and stored on their servers b The defendants prescribe the terms of use which must necessarily be subscribed to by a User for becoming a defendants User c A person has to necessarily be a registered User with the defendant MySpace to use the uploading facility which ultimately leads to infringement d MySpace defendant can without anybody s approval reject refuse to post or delete any content for any or no reason uploaded on its website e Defendants take license from the User for the content uploaded and can modify delete from and add to the said content All these factors as per Mr Sibal are evidence of the degree of control which the defendants can exercise and thus the authorization gets established once the defendants are found to be controlling the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 62 of 132 infringing activities and has its say in preventing them or controlling them 44 Mr Sibal has also made submissions that the said acts amounts to infringement as per the provision of Section 51 a ii of the Act due to aforesaid reasons 45 On the other hand Mr Kumar resisted the same by stating that neither the said acts are authorization and nor the same are falling under Section 51 a ii due to the following reasons a The defendants are having no control over the works which are uploaded on the websites everyday and thus they are no privy to any such works which are infringing in nature b The defendants are not having any knowledge about which are the works which are infringing or non infringing It is only subsequent to uploading and thereafter when the proprietor brings it to their notice it becomes clear that the works are infringing in nature Therefore once it is without knowledge coupled by no control over the works the defendants cannot be held liable for infringement c The defendants have cited the safe harbor provisions of US law and lot of cases decided under English law which has been commented on later in the judgment as at this stage the issue of infringement is decided IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 63 of 132 d It is well established that merely providing means for doing the acts which may be infringing the person cannot be held liable for authorization and therefore the defendants in the absence of clear establishment of its role in doing or promoting the infringement cannot be held liable for infringement e There are several measures or safeguards like notice and turn down and many more are already undertaken by the defendants and therefore the defendants are not infringers 46 I have examined the submissions of the parties carefully and have gone through the plaint written statement and documents filed by the parties and after doing so I am of the opinion that the acts of defendants of providing the space on internet or webspace for profit are prima facie infringing in nature The reasons for my prima facie observations can be discussed as follows a Firstly it would be wise to reiterate three proposition which I have already discussed earlier The provision of Section 51 a i and Section 51 a ii of the Act are disjunctive in nature in as much as the word or between the two makes it clear that even on satisfaction of one provision there would be an infringement of copyright IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 64 of 132 The infringement by way of authorization would fall within Section 51 a 1 read with Section 14 of the Act as against the act of permitting the place for profit which is separately provided under Section 51 a ii of the Act There is a distinction between the concept of authorization as well as the concept of permitting the place for profit and the essential ingredients for establishing the same are also different Keeping these three propositions in mind I have no hesitation to state that the acts of the defendants whereby they are offering the space over the internet getting the works uploaded through users thereafter saving in their own database with the limited licence to add amend or delete the content and thereafter communicating the said work to the public by providing some advertisements alongside the work or in the alternative gaining advertisements or sponsorships on the said basis thereafter would prima facie tantamounts to permitting the place for profit for infringement as envisaged under Section 51 a ii of the Act b The said acts of the defendants are certainly falling within the realm of an infringement under Section 51 a ii of the Act This is due to the reason that the defendants are permitting the place which is place at webspace to the users at large The said place is IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 65 of 132 not for the profit of the users only but also for the private profits or gains of the defendants The defendants do not dispute that they are running the advertisement but their stand is that some advertisements are automatically appearing due to the search engines or key words which are typed by the users The defendants although state that they are not advertising anything or earning anything due to the same But I am afraid that it is not the truth the advertisements which are attached to movie clips or are displayed prior to the starting of the clip or after the movie clip is ended are not the user provided or automatically emerging ones but are sponsored There are third kind of advertisements which are displayed till the time work is being downloaded on the website and is ready to play the said advertisements keep the user busy uptil the user reaches the definite target which is intended movie song or movie clips All this happens only when the defendants permit this to happen and to the advantage of the defendants Thus the defendants are certainly earning profits or gains and not doing anything mistakenly or bonafidely without notice as contended by them There is certainly complete element of commerce attached to it to increase the bandwidth of the users customers and sponsorship and or adds Thus the defendants are permitting the place for profit IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 66 of 132 47 Now the submission of the defendants that their acts are without knowledge or no reasonable belief of infringement are therefore would not fall within the Section 51 a ii but would be protected by the later part of the Section is also meritless It is also not difficult now to answer the question of knowledge or reasonable belief which can be immediately discerned due to following factual situations The defendants could immediately turn and say that the said provisions are made to prevent the infringement as per the international laws more specifically Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA of US However the said fact does not preclude this court from drawing any inference as to the reasonable belief of the defendants that the activities upon their website are infringing in nature Perhaps the legislature in US is more conscious of these frequent infringements on the internet and that is the reason it has enacted the special Act for IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 67 of 132 these purposes for providing curative measures and thereby giving such acts a legitimate effect by balancing the two interests one of internet infringer and another of the proprietor by providing that the post infringement curative measures as sufficient safeguards for the purposes of infringement and protecting any such infringement liability But the same may not be legal in the Indian scenario absenting such situation Therefore this Court can infer the reasonable amount of knowledge by the defendants about the infringing nature of the acts which are going to be carried on the defendants website when the defendants on their own provide with these measures Certainly there is a reasonable belief by the defendants that the acts are infringing in nature Secondly the reasonable belief or knowledge specifically to that of the plaintiff works is also present in this case This is due to the reason that the plaintiff has already notified its company name and lists of the titles owned by it The defendants have also been dealing with the plaintiff prior to the institution of the suit Thus the defendants cannot be said to be totally oblivious to the fact that the Bollywood songs which are going to be IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 68 of 132 uploaded on their website may not belong to the plaintiff Rather the defendants on its own states that while launching India centric operations the defendants have informed all the music companies about their tools Furthermore when the defendants have been notified time and again by the plaintiff about updated works and the defendants are hard pressed to remove those contents In these circumstances the defendants stand at this stage that they are totally unaware of the situation is not correct There is complete knowledge to the defendants of the infringing nature of acts which are going to be carried on their website and rather it would not be out of place to say that the defendants are also aware that the plaintiff s works are available on the website which are infringing in nature Thirdly the knowledge and reasonable belief for infringement to the defendants can be seen when one examines the mechanism of working of the defendants The defendants take the limited licence to amend or delete or modify the works suitably from the user This itself makes it evident that before uploading on the website or making it available on the website the works IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 69 of 132 in question go into the servers or the computers of the defendants where the programmers modify the said contents or amend the said contents suitably Rather the said modification also goes to the extent of adding advertisements prior to the clips or after the clips embellishing them adding logos of the companies All this is nothing but knowledge about the content what the defendants are displaying showing exhibiting Thus the defendants stand that they are totally unaware at the time of uploading what is going on and they should be protected being unconnected with anyone is also ex facie bad On the contrary at the time of uploading and till the time the said work is made available to the public on search engine form by the defendants there are sufficient steps including modification which has a major role wherein the knowledge of the defendants can be seen Fourthly the knowledge and reasonable belief of infringement is also apparent on behalf of the defendants when the defendants indulge into India centric operation as contended by the plaintiff It is also stated that the defendants have whole office dedicated to Indian IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 70 of 132 works which caters the Indian consumers The modifications of the works India centric offices or operations adding advertisements of the same language seeking licences from users to modify or alter the works informing the major copyright owners about its tool anticipating actions by them or preventing need for licences all these makes the knowledge more apparent on the face of the record Thus clearly due to complete satisfaction of the provision of Section 51 a ii the acts of defendants are prima facie infringing in nature which are violative of Section 51 a ii of the Act 48 So far as the act of authorization is concerned The said act requires sanction approval or countenance which are the wordings used in English Judgments which are more than the mere act of knowledge I have already distinguished the authorization which would fall within Section 51 a i from that Section 51 a ii of the Act which expressly provides knowledge or reasonable belief as only tests for satisfaction I shall now examine and test the acts of defendants on the principles of authorization The principles for satisfaction of authorization are laid down IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 71 of 132 in various cases which are cited at bar However for the sake of brevity the same can be culled out as follows Kindly see C B S Songs Limited Others vs Amstrad Consumer Electronics Plc Another House of Lords 1988 RPC 567 IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 72 of 132 4 Merely providing means for infringement does not establish control and therefore the person cannot be said to have approved or countenanced such act 49 Broadly English Courts have tested all the cases on these very principles while attributing the liability over the infringers or in alternative rejecting the case of infringement Mostly in cases relating to newer means like tape recorder or in the cases of jukebox which are mere means for providing recordings of songs the courts in England or common law have rejected the claims of infringement on the ground that these are merely new means for recording and nothing more unless the participation of providing the means must be shown towards the infringement Let me now examine the acts of the defendants on these principles 50 It was the contention of the defendants that no clear establishment of their involvement is made out as the portal of the defendants is such wherein every day there is much of data which is being uploaded and thus the defendants could not be held liable for authorization Further it has been said on behalf of the defendants that the defendants are themselves cautious by putting notices on the internet by calling upon to users not to upload infringing contents It is also said that the defendants are providing notice and turn down features which shows IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 73 of 132 that the said acts are not emanating from the defendants It is not the defendants who are promoting those acts 51 I have gone through the rival submissions of the parties While testing the acts of the defendants on the threshold principles available under the common law the doubts can be expressed at the prima facie stage whether the plaintiff has completely discharged its onus of proving as to whether the acts of communicating the musical works sound recordings are actuated by the countenance approval or not Mr Sibal has taken pains to inform this court that there is an element of control which has been exercised by the defendants However I am not fully satisfied whether the said factors enumerated by the Mr Sibal would sufficiently establish at this prima facie stage such degree of control by the defendants which can also be called as approval or countenance or sanctioning No doubt I have arrived at the prima facie view that there is knowledge which is clearly present at this stage wherein the defendants are aware what they are communicating But the act of approval or sanction requires the defendants participation exercise of control besides knowledge which I feel is a question which can determined only at the time of trial as at this stage it is not clearly emerging from the documents as to the state of affairs after the knowledge which may be relevant for establishing the authorization This is also more so because the approval or sanction is required to be IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 74 of 132 established particularly towards the present acts of infringement which is difficult to comment upon at this stage 52 In addition to the above one more thing which needs to be considered is that the defendants plead that the acts of the defendants are not authorization to which I have already answered the same at this stage However once the plaintiff informs about the works owned by it to the defendants the said defendants thereafter attain knowledge not only of the means to be used for infringement but also the knowledge about the rights of the plaintiff The necessary consequence which follows from the same is that once the defendants are put to notice about the rights of the plaintiff in relation to the particular works thereafter the defendants cannot continue to do the said acts in relation to the works for which the details have been provided without the permission of the plaintiff In that event the defendants after putting to notice immediately steps into the shoes of the ordinary infringer under Section 51 a i of the Act who is aware of the rights of the plaintiff copyright owner and then the question of authorization becomes irrelevant and the acts are to be adjudged from the standpoint of ordinary infringement 53 The defendants have already stated in the written statement that the arrangement done by the Division Bench is the possible solution to this proposition arising in the present case The defendants counsel has also stated that he would have no objection if the order passed by the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 75 of 132 Division Bench is continued Thus the defendant s acts are infringing in violation of Section 51 a i of the Act once the defendants are put to notice about the plaintiff rights in the respective works and in the event the defendants do not turn down the same or allow the repetition to happen 54 In these circumstances I am of the view that though the acts of the defendants are prima facie infringing in view of the satisfaction of provision of Section 51 a ii of the Act but the question of the authorization requires further proof of participation which has to be tested at the time of trial Nevertheless the defendants are infringing the plaintiff s work as their acts are falling within the alternative or disjunctive requirement for infringement under Section 51 a ii of the Act Further the defendants act may become infringing if the defendants do not turn down or allow the repeated uploads to happen after put to the notice about the plaintiff s rights in the said works Re Jurisdiction 55 Now I shall deal with other submissions of the parties point wise including the issue relating to jurisdiction At the threshold I would like to state that I have held that this court has the jurisdiction and therefore proceeded to decide the aspect of copyright infringement first I shall now discuss the reasons for arriving at the conclusion that this Court has necessary territorial jurisdiction which are as under IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 76 of 132 55 1 Firstly the present case relates to infringement of copyright wherein the remedies are conferred under the special statute The said suit for infringement of copyright can be filed and initiated at the place wherein the plaintiff carries on business or personally works for gain etc This is by virtue of non obstante clause provided under Section 62 2 of the Act which reads as under 55 2 By mere reading of the provision of Section 62 2 of the Act it becomes amply clear that the suit for infringement can be filed at the forum where the plaintiff resides or carries on business The opening words of the provision provides Notwithstanding anything contained in the code of civil procedure which means that the said provision will operate in addition to what has be provided in the Code of Civil IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 77 of 132 procedure Thus the said provision enables the suit to be filed at the place of the plaintiff which is the additional ground for attracting the jurisdiction of the court 55 3 This question is no longer res integra and put to rest by the Supreme Court while examining the said provision in the case of Exphar SA Anr vs Eupharma Laboratories Ltd Anr 2004 3 SCC 688 wherein the Hon ble Court observed Therefore the plaintiff while it has initiated the said suit at the forum where it is carrying on business has rightly initiated the suit in compliance of the provision of Section 62 2 of the Act which is the additional ground for attracting the jurisdiction In these circumstances by operation of non obstance clause the principles relating to defendants carrying on business or part of cause of action or subject matter becomes irrelevant as the present case falls under the special provisions prescribed IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 78 of 132 in the special statute The said provisions under Section 62 are in addition to and not in derogation or conflict with the general law as envisaged in the Code of Civil Procedure Thus the recourse of the defendants counsel in relation to the principles of general law is misplaced 55 4 The personal amenability of the defendants are therefore not relevant in case of suit for infringement wherein the jurisdiction is sought to be invoked by way of provisions of the special enactment when it provides for non obstante clause The said non obstante clause thus operate to its full extent and it cannot be said that there is a separate question of personal amenability of the defendants to be in the forum state which is still to be considered 55 5 It is true that that to sue a foreign defendant in this country the foreigner either must be resident and or carry on business within the jurisdiction of forum court These are the principles applicable in private International law The only exception is if such party submits to the jurisdiction However the operation of this rule is not absolute but is subject to the municipal law 55 6 It is now well settled that when the municipal law provides otherwise or overrides the private international law then the municipal law prevails over and above the principles of private international law The said principle has been comprehensively decided by Karnataka High Court in Airbus Industries Vs Laura Howell Linton ILR 1994 KAR IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 79 of 132 1370 wherein the Court has stated that even the provisions of Section 20 c of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides cause of action wholly or in part overrides the private international law The Madras High Court in Swaminathan v Somasundaram AIR 1938 Mad 731 in considering whether the Indian Courts have jurisdiction over non resident foreigners it was held that even with respect to non resident foreigners the Courts in British India have jurisdiction in personam in suits based upon a cause of action arising in British India 55 7 Thus in the present case also even assuming that the rules of private international law may have any role to play the same stands overridden by the express provision of the special act which is Copyright Act 1957 which speaks otherwise and entitles the plaintiff to sue at the place of its own forum 55 8 Secondly the argument was advanced by the defendants about the commission of torts outside India The said argument is also rejected as meritless The commission of tort in the present case is in India The website of the defendants is one which is engaged in the online business of providing and exhibiting the songs and cinematograph films worldwide including India The said website is usually accessed by Indians for downloading the songs of upcoming movies from the website of the defendants The plaintiff has substantiated the cause of action by IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 80 of 132 showing some instances of infringements which has been caused in relation to the specific works Thus the said commission of the tort has occurred or occurs in India wherein the Indian user goes to the website the defendants through its search engine exhibits the said works and the work is communicated to the public by sending the work to him and facilitating downloading or reaching to the computer of Indian user Similarly conversely when the Indian user shares the infringing work with the defendants website which goes into the servers of the defendants and saved there after the uploading The said actions are sufficient to constitute part of cause of action under Section 20 c of the Code of Civil Procedure 55 9 In the first case the tort or civil wrong is caused in India as the aspect of downloading to the computer has been occurred in India when the said work is communicated to Indian users without the permission of the plaintiff In the second case too the initiation of the tort or part of the same has occurred in India as the infringing work without the authority of the plaintiff is communicated to the defendants with a limited licence to further modify and communicate further The said commission of the acts or the part of the overt acts constitutes the part of cause of action within the meaning of Section 20 c of the Code of Civil Procedure IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 81 of 132 55 10 Section 20 c of the Code confers jurisdiction where the cause of action wholly or in part arises Thus the court where the part of cause of action will arise would have the jurisdiction to entertain and try the proceeding like in the present case So seeing from any standpoint be from special act or general code of civil procedure this court has necessary territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the proceedings However the discussion to Section 20 c of the Code becomes merely academic as the special act itself confers jurisdiction on this court by operation of non obstante clause Still I have deemed it fit to discuss the same in view of the categorical objections raised by the defendants on jurisdiction 55 11 Thirdly the reliance of the judgment of the Division Bench in Banyan Tree Supra is equally misplaced by the defendants and thus does not aid the case of the defendants at all 55 12 It is a well settled principles the judgment is an authority of what it decides and not for the proposition which can be logically deduced therefrom The said proposition has been laid down by the Supreme Court in Bharat Forge Co Ltd v Utam Manohar Nakate 2005 I LLJ 738 SC M P Gopalakrishnan Nair and Anr vs State of Kerala Ors AIR 2005 SC2053 IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 82 of 132 55 13 In Banyan Tree Supra the Hon ble Division Bench has rightly reframed the issue in the following manner 56 By mere reading of the question answered by the Hon ble Division Bench it becomes patently clear that the Hon ble Division Bench was concerned with the question wherein a passing off action whether the jurisdiction of the court can be conferred by way of website operation of the defendants or not or the case of infringement where the plaintiff is not carrying on business within the territorial jurisdiction of the court The apparent distinguishing features which make Banyan tree case inapposite to the present case are outlined as under a Firstly the case of Banyan Tree Supra was a case of passing off however the present case is a case of infringement wherein plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction on the basis of carrying on his business at the forum court It needs no further mention that it is now well settled that the tests of conferring jurisdiction on the court in the case of the passing off and the infringement are totally different Whereas the jurisdiction in infringement cases is IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 83 of 132 governed by the provisions of special act like Section 62 2 of the Copyright Act On the other hand in the passing off cases it is governed by the ordinary law of civil procedure Thus the case of plaintiff carrying on business or working for gain which is a relevant and significant consideration in the present case in view of operation of special statute was absent in the case of Banyan Tree Supra and that was the sole reason the court had difficulty in assuming the jurisdiction in Banyan Tree Supra which lead to referral to division Bench for the question to be answered b Secondly The Division Bench in Banyan Tree Supra also observed that if the case of Banyan Tree Supra would have been of infringement then the court would have had jurisdiction and the special provisions of Section 62 2 of Copyright Act 1957 as well as Section 134 2 of the Trade Marks Act are those of the kinds of the long arm provisions in the limited sense The relevant excerpt from the Banyan Tree Supra dicta is reproduced hereinafter Thus the said distinction and the caveat expressed by the Division Bench itself is sufficient to exclude the present case from that of the operation of Banyan Tree Judgment as it stands a good law which it decides and cannot be extended to infringement cases which are governed by special provisions c Thirdly assuming that the judgment of Banyan Tree Supra may be applied to the present case even then the difference in the factual matrix further takes out the present case from the application of the said dicta This is due to the reason in Banyan Tree s case supra the court was concerned with the hotel services wherein there was tendency of booking online in the hotel from every place and thus the mere act of booking cannot be held IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 85 of 132 to clothe jurisdiction on this court unless it forms a part of cause of action in the case whereas in the present case concerns with the activities of the defendants which are primarily web based which are interactive due to media presence downloading uploading and nothing else The court propounded doctrine of purposeful availment in Banyan Tree s case supra to show the nexus of the transaction with cause of action in the suit In the sharp contradistinction to the same the defendants in the present case are offering to show and communicating the Indian works to the Indian public with the interactive media inside and the user is able to view the same online download it and use it and further communicate to public The plaintiff has also substantiated the same by providing download of the sample infringement which are also forming part of cause of action Thus there is sufficient interactivity in the website which is aiming at the Indian users and shows nexus with the complaint with the suit where the plaintiff is directly aggrieved The present case would be therefore different from the case of Trade Mark infringement wherein some online transaction or a trap order is shown to clothe cause of action for the purposes of invoking jurisdiction The present case relates to complaints arising directly out of the online acts and thus cannot be rejected on the counts of IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 86 of 132 unconnected cause of action Therefore the Banyan Tree s case supra is inapplicable in the present case and rather if the tests laid down in the same are applied the present case sufficiently qualifies the tests of Banyan Tree Supra 57 Hence for all these aforesaid reasons this court will have jurisdiction to entertain and try the proceeding 58 The related argument as to jurisdiction was also raised by the learned counsel for the defendants that this Court cannot exercise the extra territorial jurisdiction as assuming jurisdiction would in this case would mean exercising extra territorial jurisdiction The said argument is rejected as baseless and the reasons for variance are outlined as under a Firstly this Court has already arrived at the finding that the court has assumed the jurisdiction on the basis of the part of cause of action which has arisen in India and the infringement is being caused in India Thus this court would have jurisdiction to entertain and try the proceedings for infringements which has been caused in India b Secondly it is merely the apprehension of the defendants that there will be some effect of extra territorial for which this court is not concerned it is neither the case of the plaintiff to give this as an extra territorial effect and nor this court is giving any such effect as contended by the defendants Rather the court is exercising the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 87 of 132 jurisdiction on the basis of the law of the land which is Copyright Act of India 1957 c Thirdly it has already been observed that the commission of tort of infringement has occurred in India which is prima facie infringing in nature the said acts are prohibited under the Copyright Act and thus this court is proceeding to do what is permissible under the law This court is not concerned with any incidental effects which the defendants are apprehensive of due to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court and that cannot come in the way of exercise of jurisdiction of this Court d There are lots of cases cited on Article 245 of the Indian Constitution wherein it has been observed about the parliamentary power to enact the extra territorial laws The said reliance of judgments is equally misplaced as in the present case this court is not concerned with the legislative competence of the any extra territorial laws The said judgments are not applicable to the present case as the court is exercising the jurisdiction on the basis of Indian law having force in India and thus the concerns are mere apprehensions of the defendants which this court cannot take care of IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 88 of 132 PROBABLE EFFECT OF AMENDMENTS UNDER THE IT ACT 2000 AS AMENDED ON 2009 ON THE REMEDIES PRESCRIBED UNDER COPYRIGHT ACT 1957 59 Now I shall discuss another aspect of impact of the amended provisions of Information Technology Act 2000 on the provisions of the Copyright Act inturn on the present case as it is the defendants contention that the provisions of IT Act relates to internet related wrongs and thus their acts are protected under the IT laws of India 60 The submission has been advanced by the defendants that the amendments made in 2009 in the IT Act 2000 will have great impact on the satisfaction of this Court for the purposes of grant or non grant of the injunction against the defendants The relevant sections of amended Act relied upon by the defendants which according to the defendants will enable the defendants to escape the liability of infringement are reproduced hereinafter IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 89 of 132 a the function of the intermediary is limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted or b the intermediary does not c The intermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties under this Act and also observes such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe in this behalf 3 The provisions of sub section 1 shall not apply if a the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced whether by threats or promise or otherwise in the commission of the unlawful act b upon receiving actual knowledge or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit the unlawful act the intermediary fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material or that resource without vitiating the evidence in any manner Explanation For the purposes of this section the expression third party information means any information dealt with by an intermediary in his capacity as an intermediary Section 81 of IT Act 2000 reads as under IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 90 of 132 Act to have overriding effect The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force Provided that nothing contained in this Act shall restrict any person from exercising any right conferred under the Copyright Act 1957 14 of 1957 or the Patents Act 1970 39 of 1970 Section 2 w of the IT Act defines intermediary as Intermediary with respect to any particular electronic records means any person who on behalf of another person receives stores or transmits that record or provides any service with respect to that record and includes telecom service providers network service providers internet service providers web hosting service providers search engines online payment sites online auction sites online market places and cyber cafes 61 The submission advanced by the learned counsel for the defendants is that the acts of the defendants are protected under Section 79 of the Act even if this court is not convinced by the argument of safe harbor provisions of the Digitial Millenium Act of US as the provision saves the liability of the intermediaries like the defendants Thus the defendant s acts of providing means of infringement and all other acts communicating the works to the public are mitigated by way of operation of Section 79 of Information Technology Act 2000 as Amended on 2009 The provision according to the defendants counsel is non obstante clause and thus will override the other acts IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 91 of 132 62 Per contra learned counsel Mr Sibal has advanced the argument that the provision of Section 79 of Information Technology Act 2000 cannot be read in isolation and has to be read along with Section 81 which provides for the overriding effect of the Act The said provisions also enacts the proviso which is also inserted by way of amendment which states that nothing contained in this Act shall restrict any person from exercising any right conferred under the Copyright Act 1957 or the Patent Act 1970 Thus as per Mr Sibal the IT Act may override any other law but by way of operation of the proviso to Section 81 the rights of the copyright owner cannot be curtailed by applying any other provision of the IT Act 63 I find that the provisions of Section 79 of the IT Act will have no bearing on the liability of infringement on the defendants due to the reasons entailed hereinafter a Firstly I find merit in the submission of Mr Sibal that conjoint reading of Section 79 and Section 81 makes it amply clear that the proviso to Section 81 prevents any provisions of IT Act to act as restriction on exercising of the rights by the copyright owner This makes it clear when read the Section 81 which provides for the overriding effect of the IT act over other laws IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 92 of 132 The proviso appended to the said section provides that nothing contained in this act shall restrict the exercising of right by any person under the Copyright Act The said proviso carves out an exception to the main enactment which is under the head of overriding effect of the IT Act 64 The scope and ambit of the proviso to the enactment has been succinctly discussed by the Apex Court in State of Rajasthan v Leela Jain 1965 1 SCR 276 wherein the Apex court has held 64 1 In the case of Sales Tax Officer Circle I Jabalpur v Hanuman Prasad 1967 1SCR831 Hon ble Bhargava J observed 64 2 Thus the combine effect of reading Section 81 and the proviso is that the provisions of IT act may override other laws for the time being in force but the cannot restrict the rights of the owner under the Copyright Act and the Patent Act In other words the rights of the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 93 of 132 owners under the Copyright Act 1957 and or Patent Act 1970 shall remain unfettered by any of the provisions of IT Act 64 3 Accordingly Section 79 cannot restrict the rights of the copyright owner by saving the liability of the defendants of the infringing acts caused under the provisions of Section 51 a ii of the Act by operation of proviso to Section 81 of the Act b Secondly I am also doubtful that even if the provision of Section 79 of the IT Act is applied to the present case whether the defendants qualifies to get the benefit of the same under the IT Act This is due to the reason that Section 79 although is a non obstante clause but is subject to Section 79 2 and Section 79 3 which provides the conditions of applicability and non applicability of the Section The said Section 79 2 a states that the Section will apply if the function of the intermediary is limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted or b the intermediary does not i initiate the transmission ii select the receiver of the transmission and IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 94 of 132 iii select or modify the information contained in the transmission c The intermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties under this Act and also observes such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe in this behalf 64 4 The use of the wordings or between a and b makes them disjunctive although c has to coexist with a or b whichever is applicable In the present case the provisions of Section 79 2 a is not fulfilled as the function of the defendants is not confined to only provide an access to communication system where the third party information is stored transmitted or hosted But rather the defendants provides access only after a limited licence to add or modify the work and thereon by adding advertisements to the said works modifying the works which means permitting the place for profit with knowledge The said acts are thus of not those kinds prescribed under the provision of Section 79 2 a which are of a limited role of merely providing an access to system containing storage medium or transmission of the third party information 65 The acts of the defendants also may not fall with Section 79 2 b as the said situation prescribed in the provision has to be satisfied conjunctively or collectively as the word used between the i ii iii is and which means all the situations must be satisfied else the said IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 95 of 132 conditions in the provision are not met with In the present case the defendant s acts do not satisfy the criteria of modification of information The defendants have attained the licence to modify the works provided by the users suitably The complaint of the plaintiff is that adding the advertisement also infringes their rights Thus the act of modification of the works by the defendants also excludes the defendants from the purview of Section 79 2 b of the Act 66 The third condition of due diligence is also doubtful as the due diligence is required while discharging his duties Thus if the defendants are put to notice about the rights of the plaintiff in certain works the defendants should do preliminary check in all the cinematograph works relating Indian titles before communicating the works to the public rather than falling back on post infringement measures The due diligence is also not satisfied when the defendants uploads the contents of the user on their server and then modify the same as per the limited licence to amend from users This means that the defendants have the chances to keep a check on the works which defendants avoid so to the reasons best known to them The due diligence is thus also doubtful although defendants contend for the satisfaction of due diligence 67 From the above it is also clear that the applicability of Section 79 is also not satisfied although by operation of proviso to Section 81 the discussion on Section 79 is not really important I do not IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 96 of 132 also find my agreement with the submission of the defendants that there will be harmonious construction between Copyright Act and IT Act if the provision of Section 79 will save the liability of the copyright infringement of the intermediaries like the defendants I think rather accepting the submission would lead to apparent disharmony or conflict between the provisions of two Acts This can be explained as follows 68 Firstly it is well settled canon of construction that the court should adopt the mode of construction which upholds the provisions of the Act and make them workable and the interpretation which makes any provision of the Act otiose must be eschewed 68 1 In High Court of Gujarat and Anr v Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor Panchayat and Ors 2003 2 SCR 799 the Supreme Court held as under 68 2 If Section 79 of the IT Act is allowed to operate as an embargo or restriction upon the exercise of the right of right holder by IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 97 of 132 saving the liability of the copyright infringement the said interpretation will render proviso to Section 81 of the IT Act otiose or unworkable The said interpretation thus leads the purpose of the proviso as redundant On the contrary if the gamut of the Section 79 is allowed to remain confined and subject to the proviso of Section 81 which is intended to be so by the legislature both the provisions can stand and work in their respective fields 68 3 Section 79 is thus meant for all other internet wrongs wherein intermediaries may be involved including auctioning networking servicing news dissemination uploading of pornographic content but not certainly relating to the copyright infringement or patent infringement which has been specifically excluded by way of proviso to Section 81 This can be only possible harmonious construction between the two Acts which makes both the Acts workable 68 4 Secondly besides making proviso to Section 81 otiose the interpretation canvassed by the defendants lead to conflict between two acts and also leads to absurd results This is due to the reason that the Copyright Act 1957 itself provides for an infringement as well as the exceptions of the infringement Once the infringement is established the remedies to the same are prescribed by Section 55 In that situation and given the fact that there is an express proviso excluding the copyright infringement from the purview of IT Act if not applied leads to IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 98 of 132 unnecessary adding further restrictions on the copyright infringements which is impermissible and therefore leads to absurd results negating the statutorily prescribed remedies for copyright infringement 68 5 Further the provisions of authorization or permitting the place for profit requires knowledge or reasonable belief and other common law requirements for establishing the infringement as discussed above Thus the said act of authorization and or permitting the place for profit itself requires knowledge and reasonable belief of infringement which are inbuilt exception to the infringement The operation of Section 79 to exempt the liability of the intermediary except in cases of knowledge is rather repetition of the same provision and if the same is allowed to operate in the way of infringement which itself requires knowledge and reasonable belief or countenance or approval in respective cases would lead to anomalous situations and would lead to absurd results 68 6 Thirdly there is no legislative disharmony by operation of the proviso to Section 81 and rather adding of proviso to Section 81 by way of amendment put the unrest into an end If Section 79 would have application to the copyright infringement which saves absolutely the liability of the intermediary without insertion of the proviso by the legislature under Section 81 then there would have been apparent conflict between the acts of infringement by way of permitting the place for profit provided under Section 51 a ii and Section 79 which saves IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 99 of 132 the liability of the intermediary Thus without insertion of the proviso to Section 81 there would have been two laws one providing the acts of intermediary or facilitator as infringement and another saving the liability 68 7 In Dwarka Prasad v Dwarka Das Saraf 1976 1 SCR 277 Hon ble Krishan Iyer J speaking for the Court observed thus 68 8 The adding of proviso is rather not only exclusionary but also clarificatory in nature which clarifies that the provisions of IT Act may not restrict the rights under Copyright Act or Patent Act as its tries to create and confer harmony between two laws and enactments so that they can operate in their respective fields Thus there is harmony by adopting the proviso rather than negating it 69 In view of the above discussion I find that there is no impact of provisions of Section 79 of IT Act as amended on 2009 on the copyright infringements relating to internet wrongs where intermediaries are involved and the said provision cannot curtail the rights of the copyright owner by operation of proviso of Section 81 which carves out an exception cases relating to copyright or patent infringement IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 100 of 132 IMPACT OF PROVISIONS OF DIGITAL MILLENIUM ACT OF US AND OTHER ENGLISH LAW 70 Now I shall deal with the possible impact of Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA of US and the other English judgments cited by the parties 71 The great stress has been laid on the judgments passed by US courts in following cases which are passed on analyzing the provisions of Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA 72 I have gone through the decisions passed by US Courts under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA and I am of the firm view that there is no corresponding law which is in pari materia to that of Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA The said Act specifically addresses the issues relating internet related wrongs however our existing law of Copyright Act 1957 does not provide any such safe harbor provisions and rather the later enactment of IT Act 2000 and its new amendment in 2009 speaks otherwise which I have already examined Section 81 of IT Act as amended in 2009 proviso to which excludes the operation of the IT law in cases of copyright infringement IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 101 of 132 73 It is trite that the court cannot re legislate or add words into the statute this has been followed in Association for Development vs Union of India Others 2010 115 DRJ 277 wherein this court approved the literal rule and observed that it is not the duty of the court to enlarge the scope of the legislation when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous The court cannot recast or reframe the legislation for the very reason it has no power to legislate The court cannot add words to a statute or reads words into it which are not there 74 It is also well settled that the laws and the provisions which are not pari materia cannot be compared This has been followed in the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Babu Khan vs Nazim Khan 2001 5 SCC 375 The following conclusion of Their Lordships is relevant para 5 5 It is true that the courts while construing a provision of an enactment often follow the decisions by the courts construing similar provision of an enactment in pari materia The object behind the application of the said rule of construction is to avoid contradiction between the two statutes dealing with the same subject But in the present case what we find is that the Madhya Bharat Land Revenue and Tenancy Act contains one integrated scheme providing for remedy to a pucca tenant claiming restoration of possession under Section 91 and 93 of the Act The Madhya Bharat Land Revenue and Tenancy Act was repealed by the M P Land Revenue Code In the repealing Act i e M P Land Revenue Code we do not find any provision like Section 93 of the Act We are IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 102 of 132 therefore of the view that Sections 9 1 92 and 93 of the Act are not in pari materia with the provision of Section 250 of the M P Code It is not a sound principle of construction to interpret a provision of an enactment following the decisions rendered on a similar provision of an enactment when two statutes are not in pari materia emphasis supplied 75 The adoption and drawing aid from the said provisions in the present scenario would thus mean adding provisions into the statute when the existing law says otherwise Thus in absence of any such law similar to Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA the reliance of the provisions and judgments passed under the said law is of no avail to the defendants and this court under existing law cannot be convinced by the reliance of the provisions of Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA of US 76 The same view was taken by constitutional bench of Supreme Court in R L Arora vs State of UP 1962 Supp 2 SCR 149 while rejecting the reading of American constitution 5th Amendment due to inconsistent provisions wherein the court observed as under and consequently that to make a use public a duty must devolve on the person or corporation holding property appropriated by the right of eminent domain to furnish the public with the use intended IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 103 of 132 and that there must be a right on the part of the public or some portion of it or some public or quasi public agency on behalf of the public to use the property after it is condemned The later view is that public use means public advantage convenience or benefit and that anything which tends to enlarge the resources increase the industrial energies and promote the productive power of any considerable number of the inhabitants of a section of the State or which leads to the growth of towns and the creation of new resources for the employment of capital and labour contributes to the general welfare and the prosperity of the whole community and giving the Constitution a broad and comprehensive interpretation constitutes a public use see American Jurisprudence Vol 18 pp 661 62 In one State where the older view is still held the court pointed out that if public use were construed to mean that the public would be benefited in the sense that the enterprise or improvement for the use of which the property was taken might contribute to the comfort or convenience of the public or a portion thereof or be esteemed necessary for their enjoyment there would be absolutely no limit to the right to take private property that it would not be difficult to show that a factory hotel etc the erection of which was contemplated would result in benefit to the public and that under this power the property of the citizen would never be safe from an invasion see ibid p 664 It is the later view prevalent in some States in America for which the respondents are contending and the result of that would be the same as pointed out above But we do not think it necessary to examine the American cases cited before us because the words in our statute are not pari materia with the words used in the fifth amendment to the American Constitution Emphasis Supplied 77 Likewise the defendants as well as the plaintiff in order to support the arguments on authorization have placed reliance on the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 104 of 132 number of cases which are decided by the UK Courts and the other courts of common law jurisdiction some granting the injunction and some refusing the same depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case The said cases are enlisted as under 78 No doubt the judgments passed by the UK Courts and in other common law jurisdictions are relevant to take into consideration on the tests laid down by the courts in order to arrive at the conclusion as to whether the acts of the defendants amount to authorization or not I have already paraphrased the said tests while examining the aspect of authorization in the preceding paragraphs Beyond that I feel the conclusions set out in each of all those cases are of less value due to the following reasons Like in UK Act of 1956 permitting the place of public IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 105 of 132 entertainment for profit is an infringement while in Indian Act of 1957 permitting any place for profit are the wordings under Section 51 which has made the differences in the interpretation as discussed above Similarly in UK CDPA Act of 1988 there are separate infringements provided for place for public entertainment for profit in the form Section 25 and infringement by way of apparatus in the form of Section 26 Further in UK Act of 1988 there are statutory indicators which excludes the liability of the persons under certain circumstances in cases of infringement by way of Appratus However Indian Act of 1957 remains the same with no such provisions Thus there is difference in provisions and the wordings which may ascribe difference meaning This is also the reason for the English court to rely more on the concept of authorization In the absence of pari materia provisions the complete reliance on these decisions may not be useful b I have not based my conclusion regarding infringement on authorization although I have analysed the tests relating to the same as I have found that the same may require active participation besides knowledge which is a matter of trial and I have found that still the acts of the defendants are hit by the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 106 of 132 provisions of Section 51 a ii of the Act In these circumstances the decisions on authorization may become of less aid as the acts of the defendants are squarely covered under the express legislative provision Accordingly principally I accept the decisions rendered on authorization and tests laid down in the same and the same can be taken into consideration for the purposes of deciding the acts of authorization but may not be helpful in the cases involving the permitting the place for profit which is a statutorily prescribed infringement RELIANCE ON INTERNATIONAL COVENANTS 79 Now I shall be dealing with the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the defendants on the reading of International covenants and adopting the same in interpreting the copyright law and especially the internet related wrongs which is The WIPO Copyright Treaty and its Article 8 It is also equally well settled that the international law and covenants can be taken recourse of in the municipal law to the extent they are not inconsistent with the municipal law and to fill the gaps in the existing law This has been accepted by Supreme Court in Visakha Ors vs State of Rajasthan 1997 6 SCC 241 IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 107 of 132 80 In the present case the defendants themselves have informed the Court that India has not even ratified the said convention Thus the reliance on the said convention into Indian law is thus misplaced Further The answer to this can be traced if one reads the judgment of Entertainment Network Supra more carefully wherein the court discusses the extent to which the international covenants can be read into the national law The relevant paragraphs of the judgment are reproduced hereinafter iii To fulfill spirit of international obligation which IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 108 of 132 India has entered into when they are not in conflict with the existing domestic law iv To reflect international changes and reflect the wider civilization v To provide a relief contained in a covenant but not in a national law vi To fill gaps in law Beginning from the decision of this court in Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala 1973 4 SCC 225 there is indeed no dearth of case laws where this Court has applied the norms of international laws and in particular the international covenants to interpret domestic legislation In all these cases this court has categorically held that there would be no inconsistency in the use of international norms to the domestic legislation if by reason thereof the tenor of domestic law is not breached and in case of any such inconsistency the domestic legislation should prevail However applicability of the International Conventions and Covenants as also the resolutions etc for the purpose of interpreting domestic statute will depend upon the acceptability of the Conventions in question If the country is a signatory thereto subject of course to the provisions of the domestic law the International Covenants can be utilized Where International Conventions are framed upon undertaking a great deal of exercise upon giving an opportunity of hearing to both the parties and filtered at several levels as also upon taking into consideration the different societal conditions in different countries by laying down the minimum norm as for example the ILO Conventions the court would freely avail the benefits thereof Those Conventions to which India may not be a signatory but have been followed by way of IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 109 of 132 enactment of new Parliamentary statute or amendment to the existing enactment recourse to International Convention is permissible 81 From the reading of the aforesaid it is clear that the international covenant wherein India is a signatory state can be utilized for limited purposes of bridging the gap between national law and international to the extent it is not repugnant with the national law I am doubtful as to whether any of the tests laid down by Supreme Court are fulfilled in the present case in order to enable this court to consider the international covenant relied upon by the defendants Firstly India has not ratified the said convention as per the defendants thus there is no international obligation which is to be respected in the present case Secondly the defendants counsel wants this court to read into the following statement to their benefit 82 There is no disputing this proposition and I have in the preceding paragraphs of my judgment laid down this proposition that merely providing means does not amount to authorization But this statement as such cannot be read into due to the non fulfillment of IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 110 of 132 principles which enables this court to read into the international covenants 83 This statement is neither bridging any gaps in the law and is rather part of the statute in India where permitting the place for profit is an infringement and not providing mere means The reading of this statement itself may not aid the case of the defendants in any event and thus I am not convinced and also not sure as to what aid the defendants intend to draw from reading of this article from the convention This also does not affect the invocation of the provision of Section 51 a ii of the Act basing upon which I have found prima facie view of the infringement 84 The submission has been made by the learned counsel for defendants that the defendants acts of providing the tools relating to notice and turn down provisions are sufficient safeguards and amounts to due diligence which should be considered to be a mitigating factor against the grant of the injunction as the defendants are taking curative measures against the possible infringement 85 I have gone through the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the defendants and I reject it being meritless This is due to following reasons I find that the said post infringement measures may not be prima facie sufficient safeguards for the infringements a Firstly I wish to again discuss Section 51 a ii of the Act read with Section 55 proviso the wordings of which nowhere permits IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 111 of 132 any room for due diligence to be exercised by the infringer and only provides an exemption for mistaken infringement on the count of lack of knowledge or the person was not aware of the said infringement Under these circumstances permitting this kind of due diligence post infringement would mean reading the words into the statute which would be impermissible under the canons of construction when the statute does not provides so b Secondly I have already concluded separately that provisions of IT Act would not curtail the remedies under the Copyright Act and Patent Act by virtue of the proviso of IT Act In these circumstances the provisions of Section 79 cannot also allow to militate against the case of established infringement under Section 51 and Section 55 of the Act c Thirdly there are no safeguards provided under the Copyright Act for the infringement in the cases like the present one wherein there is a knowledge and exercise of due diligence post infringement Rather the conjoint reading of Section 51 of the Act and proviso to the Section 55 of the Act makes it clear that the knowledge or no notice of the infringement can only assist the defendants in resisting the damages and not the injunction However in some cases like the present one under Section 51 a ii of the Act lack of knowledge can save the liability of infringement as the same is IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 112 of 132 the ingredient of the Section But certainly there is no provision which can save the liability when there is an apparent knowledge and exercise of due diligence post infringement I have already formed an opinion that the defendants are aware and has reasonable belief of infringement and thus the exercise of due diligence after the infringement cannot operate in favour of the defendants to escape the liability d Fourthly if there is any due diligence which has to be exercised in the event of absence of any provision under the Act the said due diligence must be present at the time of infringement and not when the infringement has already occurred so that the infringement can be prevented at the threshold and not when the same has already occurred The post infringement measures like the ones informed by the defendants which are in compliances of US statute may hold good in US due to the legislative measure but the same are not operative in India Such post due diligence on the ground of some inherent helplessness which the defendants are pleading only because they are sitting on internet or cyberspace may not be correct as the law does not exclude cyberspace from its purview to do infringements there The defendants have sufficient means to modify the work by taking licenses from the users adding advertisements to the works of the plaintiff Consequently the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 113 of 132 effective means for pre infringement enquires are also necessarily have to be performed by the defendants only If the defendants state that there no means to do so due to some impossibilities the defendants must take preliminary measures at the time of modification of the works and prior to making them available to the public so as to ensure that the same does not infringe any ones copyright 86 It gives me no hesitation to state that the compulsion which the defendants are pointing out of lack of corrective measures at the first instance due to multiplicity of the works or uploads and also the diversified business of the defendants is not only the plea taken by the defendants for the first time in any infringement action relating to copyright infringement It is rather applicable to any case of infringement Take for instance the case of music library or shop selling movies for hire wherein the defendants take the plea that due to multiplicity of numbers or titles one cannot identify the pirated ones from the originals But this kind of argument or plea cannot preclude the labour or burden which the defendants ought to have exercised while taking into the possession the pirated titles by enquiring as to whether they are belonging to the owner or emanating from owner or not The situation will become more complex when the same movie seller or person giving for hire will IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 114 of 132 start keeping the international titles like Hindi Movies English Movies French Movies and Pakistani titles The said labour then increases manifold and the said justification also gains more strength when he says that the due to several sources it becomes virtually impossible to keep a hold of the each and every title whether original or duplicate Even if the said person states that once it is brought to his notice by the customer or the owner that it is an infringement he immediately removes the said title from the library or the shop The said acts cannot save him from the liability of the infringement 87 Likewise in the present case the labour or the due diligence is the enquiry by the defendants themselves to be exercised The nature of portal due to which the defendants feels helpless is of less avail to mitigate the liability unless there is a statutory exemption to that effect like in Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA The defendants can do many things to stop this first that it can enquire at the stage when the defendants modify the works at that time the defendants can enquire about the titles of the work and about ownership secondly at the time of the uploading by the user the content should not immediately made the available to the public the defendants can put them to the halt subject to enquiries of the titles or authentication of the proprietor and thereafter make them available to the public IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 115 of 132 88 There is no reason to axiomatically make each and every work available to the public solely because user has supplied them unless the defendants are so sure that it is not infringement If the defendants cannot exercise diligence of this nature the necessary inferences can be drawn is that the defendants are making itself liable for infringement by its inactions to enquire about the source of the works at the appropriate stage 89 Thus even if the post infringement measures which may be acceptable in certain legal systems due to the specific legislations may not be hold good in India when the statute in India does not culls out any such exception as mitigating factor 90 Now I shall be discussing the argument raised by the counsel for the parties on the reliefs The extensive submissions have been made at the Bar about the nature of the relief 91 Mr Sibal has submitted that the present case warrants complete interim injunction in terms of the prayers made in interim application wherein the defendants can be restrained from communicating the plaintiff s works to the public as the current arrangement as directed by Division Bench is not sufficiently protecting the rights of the plaintiff Mr Sibal states that the current arrangement enables the infringement to first happen and then comes corrective action which is belated in cases of internet wrongs therefore the plaintiff seeks more directions from this IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 116 of 132 Court so that the defendants do not infringe the works of the plaintiff Mr Sibal submits that even the order of Division Bench itself states that the same is tentative and cannot come in the way of deciding the injunction application 92 On the other hand Mr Kumar has submitted that the injunction in terms of the prayers made in the interim application cannot be granted due to following reasons IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 117 of 132 d That the term of the order granting an injunction should be such that it is quite plain what it presents and what it prohibits An order which merely prohibits a man from doing what he has no authority to do without showing him what the limits of his authority are and leaves him to find what is forbidden and what is allowed is irregular e That in the present matter the relief of omnibus injunction as sought by the Plaintiff is not only impossible to comply with by the defendants due to the existing technological limitations but this Hon ble Court will not be able to enforce the same unless the legitimate website of the defendant No 1 is shut down Besides this Hon ble Court would require continuous monitoring of the defendant No 1 s website which is neither feasible nor in the spirit of law f That the relief of the general injunction cannot be granted as the plaintiff has not shown the title on the copyright on each and every work The defendants also dispute the assignments of the copyright being not in order Further the defendants allege that the assignment in every work pertains to several restrictions such as restriction as to terms restriction as to home viewing etc Thus till the time the assignment deeds are examined The plaintiff is not IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 118 of 132 entitled to the relief of injunction much less the omnibus injunction Thus the defendants contend that the injunction of such nature is difficult to comply which necessitates non grant of such order which cannot be enforced 93 I have examined the submissions of the parties on the issue of grant of wider relief which has been mentioned in the Interim application I am of the opinion that the court is not powerless to protect the interest of the party in cases involving civil wrongs when it involves recurring infringements or infractions I shall now proceed to discuss the reasoning to this effect 93 1 Firstly the defendants concern that the plaintiff has not substantiated the cause of action by certainly providing the infringements against which it requires prohibitory relief The said submission of the defendants do not aid their case as indeed the plaintiff has been able to procure the sample infringements which are entailed in the plaint out of the mass infringements which are occurring over the internet on day to day basis It is the case of the plaintiff s that it is the owner of repertoire of the musical works and sound recordings Out of this repertoire if the plaintiff is able to show some sets of infringements and is also able to show that the defendant s acts are such which amounts to permitting the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 119 of 132 place for profit for infringement purposes and there is a complete certainty of future infringements There is no reason why this court should continue to allow the defendants to use that place for profit of the defendants against the infringement of the plaintiff works which includes current works and future works of the plaintiff 93 2 It would be wrong understanding of the law to state that the infringements can be prohibited only when the torts are perfected The principle of quia timet is not only confined to the trade mark infringements as propounded by the learned counsel for the defendants The said submission is also misplaced and rejected as meritless 93 3 The principle of quia timet is applicable to any tortuous liability wherever there is an apprehension of infringement likely to happen This can be seen even in the cases of trespass where the injunctions are sought even when there is threat of invasion in the property of someone The principle of quia timet has been explained by John George Woodroffe in his book The Law Relating to Injunctions in the following words that is the Court assists the party who seeks its aid because he fears quia timet some future probable injury to his rights or interests and not because an injury has already occurred which requires any compensation or other relief So the remedy by temporary Injunction being preventive IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 120 of 132 in its nature it is not necessary that a wrong should have been actually committed before the Court will interfere since if this were required it would in most cases defeat the very purpose for which the relief is sought by allowing the commission of the act which the complainant seeks to restrain And satisfactory proof that the defendants threaten the commission of a wrong which is within their power is sufficient ground to justify the relief 93 4 Likewise Hugh Laddie in his book titled as The Modern Law of Copyright by Laddie Presscott Victoria at p 405 observes about the nature of relief which can be sought in relation to infringements by way of authorization like in the present case in the following words 93 5 In Fletcher v Bealey 1885 28 Ch D 688 the principles that should be followed by a Court when dealing with an application for an injunction quia timet when infringement of the plaintiff s rights is only apprehended were succinctly laid down by Pearson J who said as follows at page 698 There must if no actual damage is proved be proof of imminent danger and there must also be proof that the apprehended damage will if it comes be very substantial I should almost say it must be proved that it will be irreparable because if the danger is not proved to be so IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 121 of 132 imminent that no one can doubt that if the remedy is delayed the damage will be suffered I think it must be shown that if the damage does occur at any time it will come in such a way and under such circumstances that it will be impossible for the plaintiff to protect himself against it if relief is denied to him in a quia timet action 93 6 Thus the submission that this court cannot prevent future wrongs on the basis of quia timet injunction is also not correct as it is equally applicable to infringement of copyright like in any other tortuous act Accordingly the plaintiff is entitled to relief on the basis of quia timet action as the defendant s nature of activities is such where the plaintiff s works is liable to infringe and more so when the defendants are notified about the plaintiff s several works The said danger of infringement is imminent risk of substantial damages with certainty as the defendants have already done several infringements and will continue to do so in the light of the continuous acts of the defendants The plaintiff s interest is also to be protected against such infractions which are possible by way of injunction and any court jurisdictionally competent can grant the relief prayed for quia timet action 93 7 Secondly the submission of the defendants that the injunction order of the nature wherein the defendants are restrained from infringing the plaintiff s works in general cannot be granted as the defendants must know for what the defendants are restrained is also not correct If the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 122 of 132 defendants at this stage are already notified about the plaintiff s works for the purposes of notice and turn down provisions and is also conscious of the fact that the plaintiff owns most of Hindi movie titles and its copyright there cannot be anything specific than stating that the defendants are restrained from using the works of the plaintiff 93 8 It is only the apprehension of the defendants that they could not trace out the ownership of the plaintiff in each and every work However if one sees carefully the application of the notice and turn down facility provided by the defendants wherein the owners are chasing the infringers for turning their infringements down from the website as against the infringers chasing the owners the problem of infringement can be resolved by applying the same conversely wherein infringers must legitimize the acts with the owners prior to committing any such infringements This can be done only by the order of the court of prohibitory nature wherein the prior notice to the owners and steps to find ownership can be taken by the defendants by taking preventive actions prior to infringements 93 9 These apprehensions of the defendants about inability of enforce or implement the order of this court are unfounded Further the concern of the defendants that their website hosts the acts which are infringing as well as non infringing and it is difficult to segregate all this IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 123 of 132 and rather impossible is also unmeritorious Such concerns are taken care by the courts while granting injunctions in copyright infringements 93 10 In Garware Plastics and Polyester Ltd and Ors etc v Telelink and Ors etc AIR 1989 Bom 331 wherein Hon ble Bombay High Court had examined this kind of concern wherein the court observed that it is true that there are certain places like hotels where there are private viewings as well as public viewings some of which are infringement and some are not But still the court proceeded to grant the injunction against the defendants from infringing the plaintiff s works in respect of which the plaintiff is the owners and or assignees of copyright without obtaining an assignment of the same from such owners and assignees or a licensee under the Copyright Act 1957 93 11 Similarly in the cases involving mass infringements like the cases instituted by Performing Rights Society Phonographic Societies which not only espouse the cause of one copyright owner but is a collective action the mere fact of non crystallization of all the infringements does not preclude the courts from granting the injunctions basing on the prima facie ownership of the plaintiff s works and sample infringements All these injunctions are being granted by this court from time to time Thus this concern of the defendants has no meaning and the injunction of the nature asked by the plaintiff cannot be faulted with considering the acts of the defendants which are infringing in nature and IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 124 of 132 the equal level of certainty with which the future infringement may arise 93 12 Thirdly the submission that this court cannot grant injunction in view of the Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act 1963 I am of the opinion that the Section 14 of the Act puts no embargo for the grant of the relief in the present case This is due to the following reasons The present dispute relates to remedy which is statutorily prescribed by the special law of Copyright I have already stated that quia timet action can be maintained in the IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 125 of 132 appropriate cases as permissible by the law Thus in the present case the remedies prescribed by the special law will also operate over and above the remedies prescribed under the general law relating to contracts Section 14 d of the Act has been greatly stressed by the counsel for the defendants has also no applicability in the present case However in the present case it would be incorrect to assume that the court cannot supervise the infringement of copyrights of the plaintiff s works in the event the court directs the defendants to take pre infringement measures to cut down infringement of the plaintiff s work If the defendants are guilty of non performance or implementation of the order the court can call for the records of the cache on the internet and downloads from the relevant sources whereby it can supervise whether the defendants have complied with the said order or not 94 More importantly if the plaintiff files separate suits for number of infringements the moot question is whether the said acts can be monitored in that case or not The answer to my knowledge is in affirmative If that is so then it can be monitored now also by directing IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 126 of 132 the defendants not to do the infringing acts It would be rather futile exercise to relegate the plaintiff to file separate suits after perfection of infringements and allowing the defendants to continue to ride over the works of the plaintiff till that time 95 The challenge to the assignment deeds which has been made by the defendants are only confined to the defects in the respective assignment pointed by the defendants The said defects in the assignments are disputed by the plaintiff by stating that the said assignments are proper and are in order which can be furnished before the court All this is more of a question of trial at the time of evidence At this stage for the purposes of forming a prima facie opinion the assignments filed with documents are taken as correct as no contrary or no cogent evidence to disprove the same has been placed on the record by the defendants On the basis of the documents it can be stated that the plaintiff is the owner of copyright otherwise no one would have executed the assignment deeds Therefore the title of the ownership of the plaintiff is sufficient to form prima facie view Accordingly this court is not precluded from passing interim order in terms of the prayers made in IA No 15781 2008 whereby the defendants can be restrained from infringing the copyrighted works of the plaintiff online by permitting place for profit No further submission remains unanswered IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 127 of 132 96 The principles for the grant of temporary injunction have been succinctly discussed in Dalpat Kumar Anr vs Prahlad Singh Ors AIR 1993 SC 276 wherein the apex court has stated that for the purposes of grant of temporary injunction the court must test the case of the parties on threefold tests 97 The plaintiff has been able to make out a prima facie case as the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright in the works enumerated in the plaint The plaintiff has also been able to establish prima facie that the acts of the defendants are infringing in nature as the same are permitting the webspace or place on internet for profit The prima facie case thus is in favour of the plaintiff The balance of convenience lies in favour of the plaintiff as the defendants would be less inconvenienced if they are directed to not to infringe the plaintiff s works as it is their own case is that the defendants are doing business from multifarious jobs on internet and the works of the plaintiff is no means of profit As against the same the plaintiff is totally dependants upon its works for the purposes of royalties reaping fruits of its copyright for further investments etc thus the plaintiff would be more inconvenienced if its works are continued to IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 128 of 132 be exploited for profit without its permission The irreparable loss would also ensue to plaintiff if the works of the plaintiff are allowed to be made public for permitting the place on internet for profit as against the defendants who will loose nothing more than users on internet which as per themselves are trivial part of their business model 98 Consequently the present case warrants the grant of interim injunction for the purposes of prevention of infringement of the plaintiff s works However this court is not precluded from granting the interim relief in the moulded form so that the infringement can be prevented which is in fact the relief asked by the plaintiff in its interim application Accordingly the following interim directions and orders are passed c Further the defendants are also directed to verify from the plaintiff independently without waiting the direction under b to be complied with by the plaintiff on their own by IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 130 of 132 other means continuously

infringing works immediately after the gaining the said knowledge d In relation to the works of the plaintiff which are already turned down once by the defendants the defendants are restrained from further allowing the continuation of the uploadings or its existence on its website of the same works which have already been turned down deleted by the defendants at the behest of the plaintiff request This has been already stated by the defendants by explaining their various tools for preventing infringement wherein the defendants possess the necessary tools and the technology which identifies and prevents the repetitions in infringements after its first posting and deletion Accordingly the defendants are directed to ensure the deletions and the preventions of repetitions on their own after putting to notice by the plaintiff about the works by availing their own tools and not by the calling the plaintiff to do this by some subscription IA Nos 15781 2008 3085 2009 in CS OS No 2682 2008 Page No 131 of 132 In this way the parties in the interim can prevent the infringements and its occurrence on the website of the defendants till the disposal of the suit The orders passed in the interim applications are tentative in nature and does not come in the away of the court at the time of hearing of the matter after the completion of the trial 99 Consequently the plaintiff s application being IA No 15781 2009 U o 39 R 1 2 CPC is allowed and defendants application being IA No 3085 2009 U o 39 R 4 CPC is dismissed with cost of Rs 20 000 100 IA No 15781 2009 and IA No 3085
